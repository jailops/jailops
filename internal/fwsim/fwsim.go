// Package fwsim answers "would this packet pass the anchor of a jail?" by walking the very list of rules the
// renderer loads into pf (render.Anchor.Rules). pf takes the first matching rule and every rule JailOps writes is
// quick, so the first rule in the list that matches decides. There is no second implementation of the policies: what
// is walked here is what was rendered from them.
//
// The answer is for a new connection. It says Unknown, and why, wherever it cannot decide: a raw PF fragment, an ICMP
// type the packet does not name, a packet no rule of the anchor matches (the host's own rules decide then).
