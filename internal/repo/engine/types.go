// Package engine is the in-process backup and restore engine over a repository.
//
// Backup walks a directory tree per dataset (a read-only mounted ZFS snapshot
// is just a directory), compares it with the previous snapshot's catalog,
// reads only what changed, cuts it into chunks, uploads the chunks the
// repository does not have and commits one snapshot with one index and one
// manifest. Restore reads chunks through a read-ahead window, decrypts them,
// recomputes their ids and verifies every file's SHA-256.
//
// The engine talks to the repository through two small interfaces: Uploader,
// the write side of one snapshot, and Repository, the read side. The Store
// implements them in process; the HTTP client of the backup node implements them
// remotely. The engine never holds a whole object in memory: chunks are at most
// 8 MiB and at most a read-ahead window of them are in flight.
