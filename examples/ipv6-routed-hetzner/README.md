# ipv6-routed-hetzner

A server for which the provider **routes a whole `/64` to the host** (a dedicated server or a cloud server with a routed
prefix). The upstream already knows the prefix lives behind the host, so **no NDP proxy is involved**; the host just
forwards. Each project gets its own `/80` of the `/64` (a routed `/64` holds 65,536 of them):

| Project | Network | IPv6 `/80` | Jails |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blog` | `blog` | `2001:db8:abcd:1:1::/80` | `site` (public) |
| `mail` | `mail` | `2001:db8:abcd:1:2::/80` | `mx` (SMTP) |

Replace `2001:db8:abcd:1::/64` with the prefix your provider routes to you and `vtnet0` with the uplink.

## What the example shows

- `ipv6.mode: routed` with a real gateway address on the gateway interface (`2001:db8:abcd:1:1::1`).
- Two projects, two networks, no sharing; `firewall: floor` in both.
- Fixed IPv6 addresses for the public jails (`::80`, `::25`) so DNS and rules can name them.
- Dual stack: IPv4 is NATed through the host's address, with `proxy:` devices for the web ports.

## Before you apply

- Forwarding must be on (`gateway_enable`, `ipv6_gateway_enable`; install.md section 4) and `pf.conf` needs the three
  anchor lines.
- Admit the prefix at the host's door if your `pf.conf` blocks inbound traffic by default (install.md section 3).

## Run it

    jailops-sync -C examples/ipv6-routed-hetzner validate
    jailops-sync -C examples/ipv6-routed-hetzner plan       # compare with EXPECTED-PLAN.md
    jailops-sync -C examples/ipv6-routed-hetzner sync --apply

## Verified, and not

Routed mode with a dual-stack managed bridge is verified on FreeBSD 15.1 arm64: FreeBSD, Alpine and Debian jails reached the
internet over IPv4 and IPv6. **UNVERIFIED:** traffic from the internet into a jail over a routed prefix (the test host has
no IPv6 route to it), and the automatic carving of `/80`s and a reject route for the unallocated rest of the `/64`: neither is
implemented, you choose each `/80`, as this example does.
