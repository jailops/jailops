# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **An installed app starts when the host boots.** `jailops app install` sets `boot.autostart`, so a service comes back
  after a reboot without a second command; `jailops config set JAIL boot.autostart false` turns it off for one jail.

- **Boot order: which jails start with the host, in which order, and why one does not.** `jailops boot` shows what the daemon starts after a boot, from the jails as they are now: the jails in the order they start with the reason (`autostart`, or `dependency of NAME`), and the jails with autostart it does not start with why (a dependency cycle, a dependency that does not exist, an encrypted volume that waits for its passphrase, a jail that depends on such a jail). The order is that of the whole host (a jail after its `boot.depends`, then the lower `boot.priority`, then the name); you see the jails of every project you may use, or one with `--project`. `GET /api/v1/boot` (extension `boot_plan`, readonly), `api.BootPlan`, `c.BootPlan(ctx, allProjects)`; the order is computed by the one function the boot pass uses. `jailops list` has an `AUTOSTART` column (`yes` or `-`), and the create examples, `jailops create --help` and the install guide say that a jail without `--autostart` does not start when the host boots, also when it was running before.
- **Breaking: a project is a boundary, and across projects there are only addresses.** `jailops app allow` no longer takes `@PROJECT/JAIL`, and no command writes a rule into a project it was not asked about (the outbound rule in the source jail's own `app-JAIL` policy is gone, with the registry fields and the rename checks that carried it). Another project is treated like an external host: the app's project allows an address or an address set in, and the other project's operators allow the app's addresses out in a policy of their own. Things that talk to each other as one system belong in the same project. The documents, the help, the completion and the console say so.
- **`@jail` means the same everywhere.** A grant `app allow APP from @web` keeps `@web` in its firewall rule (read at every render, as in any rule) instead of a copy of the addresses. `pg_hba.conf` cannot follow, so its lines are still a copy: `jailops app access` and `jailops doctor` report `the addresses of @web are now ... but the pg_hba lines name ...`, and repeating the allow writes them again. A jail that a grant names is not deleted or renamed until the grant is denied, and the refusal says `jailops app deny APP from @web`. A jail whose name is too long for a rule is refused as a source with the address-set way out. The dead "both a jail and an address set" refusal and its comment are gone (names cannot clash).
- **Breaking: a policy always says its defaults.** `default_in` and `default_out` are required on every firewall policy (API, files, `policy create` flags, the console form, the fleet check; the managed `app-JAIL` policy says `deny` and `allow`). A policy that was stored without one is not rendered with a default of ours: the jail keeps its anchor, the error names the policy and the field and says `jailops firewall policy edit NAME`, and `jailops doctor` fails `firewall.defaults` naming each such policy. `jailops jail info` shows `Firewall:` with the policy, or `open: no firewall policy`.
- **Breaking: `includes` of an address set is gone.** A set names another set with a member `@name`, as it names a jail (`--include`, the `includes` field, the console field, the fleet check and the backup bundle follow `@name` members). Deleting or renaming a set protects the sets that name it as a member.
- **A jail's own policy is its own.** `firewall.policy` of a jail may not name a policy that something else manages (`app-JAIL`) or the project's mandatory policy, which is rendered for every jail already; the API, `jailops fleet` and the console refuse it with the reason.
- **One table of endpoints** in `docs/networking-ipv6.md`: an address or prefix, `@name`, `tag:name` (rules only), `host` (`app allow` only). Two rebuilds of an anchor (a jail's DNS change and a rename) left jails out of the sets and failed on a rule that names one; they read the sets with the jails now.
- **Interface ownership is the description, only.** The helper changes a bridge or epair when it carries the JailOps
  description; a name, a prefix or an undescribed interface never makes it JailOps's. **Removed:** `if-prefix` of
  `priv.conf` and `-if-prefix` of `jailops-priv`, the acceptance of undescribed `jo` interfaces, the `jailops:<id>`
  marker, the old socket name of the helper, and the special messages for the removed `listen.unix.*_group` keys and
  the backup node's `admin_group` (an unknown key is an unknown key) and the `private` option of a network, which had no effect (every jail port is a private bridge member).

## 0.6.4 - 2026-11-09

- **A firewall rule can name a jail: `from @web`, and so can an address set.** `@name` is an address set of the project or a
  jail of the project and stands for its addresses; they are read at every render, so a rule follows the jail. One name
  never means both: a jail and an address set of a project may not have the same name, with `-` read as `_` (`web-1` and
  `web_1` are one pf table), and the second one is refused when it is made or renamed. A member of an address set may be
  `@name` too, so a list such as `git_allow` holds jails and is added to later. A name with a hyphen works (`@web-2`); a jail
  whose name is longer than 29 characters needs an address set. A name that is neither is refused when the policy or the set
  is made. A jail that a rule or a set names is not renamed or deleted until the reference is changed (the refusal names the
  policy or the set): a rule that names a jail that is gone would match nobody, and a jail made later under the name would take
  its place. A restored or declared policy that names a missing jail still renders, as an empty set. Renaming an address set
  rewrites the `@name` members of other sets. `jailops firewall policy create db --rule "allow in tcp from @web port 5432"`,
  as `app allow` has `@JAIL`. `jailops fleet` checks the references of a declared repository (`@name` is a set or a jail
  declared for the host).
- **Every part of the firewall has a `comment`, for the review of it.** An address set, each of its entries (`addresses:` is
  a list of `{address, comment}` pairs), a policy and each rule: what it is, why it is there. They are what a reviewer of the
  firewall reads next to `@office` or a port: `address-set show` and `policy show` list them in a table, the rendered anchor of
  a jail carries them as comment lines (`# set NAME: MEMBER COMMENT`, `# rule 1: NAME` and `#   WHY`, `# policy: ...`), and the
  console has a comment field on a set, a policy and every rule, and takes the comment of a member at the end of its line
  (`198.51.100.0/24  # the office`). A comment is one line of printable text of at most 200 characters, without double quotes or backslashes (it becomes a comment line of the ruleset, and a backslash would continue it onto the next line), and is not part of any rule.
  `jailops firewall address-set create office --address 192.0.2.7 --comment "the office"` (`--comment` goes with a single
  `--address`; one entry is one address, so an IPv4 and an IPv6 network are two entries, each with its own comment; several
  commented entries come from a file or `address-set edit`), `jailops firewall policy create web
  --comment "the public web server" --rule "allow in tcp port 80,443 comment the site"` (`comment` ends a rule and takes
  the rest of it). **Breaking:** `addresses` was a list of strings; it is a list of pairs now, in the API, in files and in
  `address-set` YAML (the examples are rewritten).
- **Interfaces of a network that is gone are removed.** A host wiped by hand (the datasets destroyed, the configuration
  deleted) keeps the bridge and the gateway pair of its networks, because interfaces live in the kernel; they stayed until
  a reboot or an `ifconfig destroy`. The reconcile loop now destroys the bridge and the gateway pair that carry JailOps's
  description (`jailops net=NAME ...`) for a network it does not know; an interface with any other description is left
  alone. "Start over" in the install guide also destroys them (it matched only `wg-` and `epair` names, and the gateway
  pair is named after the network).

## 0.6.3 - 2026-11-05

- **The text the package prints is a file of the source** (`packaging/pkg/post-install.sh`): a first install says to run
  `jailops-setup`, an upgrade says `service jailopsd restart`. The recipe of the package reads the file, so a change of the
  text ships with a release and no longer needs an edit in the packages repository.
- **One service: `sysrc jailopsd_enable=YES` and `service jailopsd start`.** The helper has no line of its own any more:
  `jailops_priv_enable` (and the boot-time revert of a pending host change, which follows it) defaults to the value of
  `jailopsd_enable`, and `jailopsd` starts the helper first. `service jailopsd setuptoken` prints the one-time token of
  the first-run setup: the helper behind it is in `/usr/local/libexec`, not in `PATH`, and nobody runs
  it by hand. `jailops-setup` enables and starts only `jailopsd`. The install guide, the README, the man pages and the
  site say so everywhere (no `jailops-priv init` or `service jailops_priv start` as a step).
- **The two services, after a crash and an upgrade**: daemon(8) now supervises `jailops_priv`, so a helper that
  crashes (or is killed) is started again after 5 seconds instead of leaving the host without it; `stop` ends the
  supervisor, `reload` signals the helper itself, and `status` prints the helper's pid or that it is being restarted.
  `service jailopsd start` while the helper is not running starts the helper first, as rc.subr's `force_depend` does for
  the scripts of `/etc/rc.d` (the daemon used to start, wait 30 seconds for the socket and exit), a start while the helper still runs a binary a
  package upgrade replaced warns, and `service jailopsd status` also says whether the helper runs. The helper's rc
  script now requires `syslogd`, so its first audit lines are not lost at boot. `service jailopsd stop` stops the
  helper after the daemon, so `service jailopsd restart` replaces both after a `pkg upgrade` (`service jailops_priv`
  alone still works on the helper only).

## 0.6.2 - 2026-11-05

- **`jailops doctor` checks a `pf.conf` only root can read** (`pf.state-policy`): a `pf.conf` of mode 0600 is common,
  and the daemon (user `jailops`) cannot open it, so the check warned that it could not. The helper (root) now reads
  `/etc/pf.conf` and reports whether it has `set state-policy if-bound`. A `pf.conf` named by `pf_rules` in another
  place the daemon cannot read is shown as INFO, with the command that checks it.
- **`jailops doctor` says when the client's current project does not exist on the server** (`project`): the current
  project is kept in the client configuration (`~/.config/jailops/config.yaml`), so after a host was wiped it named a
  project the server no longer had, and the line read as a permissions problem. It names the project, where the choice
  comes from and how to choose another (`jailops project switch NAME`). "Start over" in the install guide says so.
- **`jailops-setup`: one command after `pkg install jailops`** (`/usr/local/sbin/jailops-setup`, `man jailops-setup`):
  as root it loads the kernel modules, runs `jailops-priv init` (the pool is found when there is one; `-pool` otherwise),
  turns forwarding on now and at boot, puts the three anchor lines into `/etc/pf.conf`, enables and starts
  `jailops_priv` and `jailopsd` with the web console, runs `jailops doctor`, offers to create the first administrator
  and prints the console's address. Each action is printed before it runs, `-n` changes nothing, and a second run
  changes nothing either. In `pf.conf` no existing line is changed or moved: missing lines are inserted where pf wants
  them (`set state-policy if-bound` and a scrub rule only when there are none), the old file is kept with a timestamp,
  the new text is checked with `pfctl -nf` before it is written and loaded with `pfctl -f` (open ssh sessions stay);
  pf is never restarted, and starting it is announced and asked for (`-y` answers yes). The package message named
  `jailops-priv init`, which is not in `PATH` (`/usr/local/libexec`); it now names `jailops-setup`.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-11-05

- **Image builds share one package cache**: the dataset `<pool>/jailops/cache` (mounted at `<mount-base>/cache`, made by
  the first build) holds the downloaded packages (`PKG_CACHEDIR`), so a package of the base is fetched once, not into
  every generation. `pkg clean` removes only the outdated ones.
- **The logs of the jails have a dataset**: `<pool>/jailops/logs` mounted at `/var/log/jailops` (lz4, made by
  `jailops-priv init`; the rc script makes the directory on a host set up by an older release). The files
  `jail_NAME_console.log` moved there from `/var/log` (the old ones stay), and newsyslog rotates them
  (`/usr/local/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/jailops.conf`: 7 files of 1 MB, compressed).
- **A new image has an `/etc/rc.conf` for jails**: `sendmail_enable="NONE"` (no MTA started in every jail) and
  `syslogd_flags="-ss"` (no network socket). The base ships no rc.conf; an image built before has none, change it in
  the jail with `sysrc`.
- **An image build and upgrade no longer leave the downloaded packages in the image**: they stayed in `/var/cache/pkg`
  of every generation (see the shared package cache above).
- **Jails get a nameserver without `--dns`.** A network without `dns` used to give its jails an empty `resolv.conf`
  (`pkg` failed with "Transient resolver failure"). Now the order is: the network's `dns`; else the host's own
  nameservers from `/etc/resolv.conf` (not loopback, not link-local); else, on a host that resolves only through
  loopback (a local unbound), the network's gateway address, with the unbound lines the administrator adds (JailOps
  changes nothing on the host and opens no port). `network show` and the API (`status.dns`) say which applies;
  `network create` prints the lines once; `doctor` (`network.dns`) probes the gateway with one query once a jail on the
  network runs ([networking-ipv6.md](docs/networking-ipv6.md#name-resolution-of-jails)).
- **A change of a network's `dns` reaches the running jails at once**, without a restart: their `resolv.conf` is written
  again and `network edit` names them (`status.dns.updated`, and `not_updated` with the reason). A stopped jail gets it
  at its next start.
- **A jail can keep its own `resolv.conf`**: with the line `# jailops:keep` in it JailOps never writes the file (a jail
  that runs its own resolver).
- **`jailops doctor` warns about a missing `set state-policy if-bound`** (`pf.state-policy`): a loaded ruleset that
  blocks by default, NAT or jails, and a `pf.conf` without the line lose all but the first packet of a jail's flow
  (reproduced on a FreeBSD 15.2 VM: one ping of four, four of four with the line).
- **The FreeBSD patch level of a generation is shown.** A new generation records the FreeBSD version of its packages
  (`15.1-RELEASE-p6`, from `FreeBSD-runtime`); `image show` and `image generations` have a column `FREEBSD`, `jailops
  list` writes `freebsd-15-1 (g1, p6)` (it wrote `freebsd-15-1 (freebsd-15-1#g1)`), the console shows it on the Images
  page and the jail's page. g1 is JailOps's generation counter; a generation built before shows `-`
  ([upgrade.md](docs/upgrade.md)).
- **Values the host would refuse later are refused when they are given.** A network, a jail or a project was accepted
  and then failed at the first jail start or inside the create operation; each of these is now refused at create or
  update with the reason and a hint:
  - Sizes are stored as bytes. `4GiB`, `512m` or `1k` as a project's storage quota was written verbatim to ZFS and
    refused by the helper at the first jail create, and `--disk 4GiB` failed inside the create ("bad disk quota");
    the quota was also set again on every pass because bytes were compared with the text. Sizes above 16T (the
    helper's limit) are refused.
  - An attachment MTU (`nic.<device>.mtu`) other than its network's: a bridge gives every port its own MTU (on
    FreeBSD 15.2 the jail's end kept the other MTU and large frames were lost).
  - A network whose subnet overlaps an address of the host (its uplink's LAN, for example), naming the interface; a
    routed IPv6 prefix likewise; a proxy-mode subnet outside the prefix of the uplink's segment.
  - An uplink that does not exist (`--uplink em9` rendered a NAT rule on nothing and the network looked ready), or is
    a loopback, a bridge, a jail interface or a bridge member; the hint lists the host's candidates.
  - A snapshot name of more than 64 characters, with upper case letters or starting with `jo-` (the API took up to
    128 characters, the operation 101). One rule: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,63}$`.
  - A WireGuard name of more than 12 characters without `--interface` now says so, instead of naming the interface
    field the caller never set.
  - Names and datasets too long for what is derived from them (ZFS names have at most 255 characters, a PF anchor
    path that `pfctl -a` loads at most 63): `project create --new-network` derives the network and bridge from the
    project name.
- **Name limits for new objects** ([design.md](docs/design.md#31-names-and-their-limits)): project 13 characters, jail,
  volume and image 32, snapshot 64, a storage dataset 88. Existing objects with longer names keep working;
  `jailops doctor` lists them (`names.length`). The console shows the limits on the name fields.
- `network create` warns when IPv4 or IPv6 forwarding is off: the network stays not ready (Precondition) until
  `sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1` (`sysrc gateway_enable=YES`).
- `project create --new-network` skips subnets of the pool the host already has on an interface.
- `project show` and `jail info` show sizes stored as bytes in their unit (`quota 4G`); `config set` takes the sizes
  the flags take (`512m`, `4GiB`).

- **The default prompt has a space after it** (`root@test:/# ` and not `root@test:/#`): what is typed no longer touches
  the prompt. A jail that already has the old prompt file gets the new one with `jailops jail shell-setup NAME`.
- **`jailops doctor` does not call a feature missing that the server was not given.** A host without a backup node, a
  sealed-secrets identity or the host modules lacks their API extensions on purpose; the check said "the server lacks:
  backup_pull, backup_push, ..." on every such host. Only extensions every server of the release has are reported.
- **The default base of an image is the minimal jail set plus the optional jail set.** The minimal set alone (35 packages)
  left out what software from the FreeBSD ports expects of a base system: PostgreSQL stopped with `libexecinfo.so.1 not
  found`, and `sysrc` was "command not found" in a new jail. `FreeBSD-set-optional-jail` (about 105 packages, 160 MiB:
  libexecinfo, sysrc, ssh, ee, ntp, ftp, telnet, bmake and the rest of what a FreeBSD jail normally has) is now part of
  the default; the development set (compiler and headers, 570 MiB) is not, and an image that builds software names
  `FreeBSD-set-devel` in `source.sets`. An image with its own `source.sets` is unchanged; an image with none gets the
  optional set in its next generation (`jailops image upgrade IMAGE`).
- **The default storage mount is `/usr/local/jailops`** (it was `/jailops`, a new directory directly under `/`). The FreeBSD
  Handbook keeps jails under `/usr/local/jails` and `hier(7)` advises against new top-level directories; the dataset stays
  `<pool>/jailops`. Only the default of `jailops-priv init -mount`, `mount_base` of `jailopsd.yaml` and `mount-base` of
  `priv.conf` changed: an installed host keeps the value in its configuration and works as before. There is no
  in-place move yet (the datasets of images and jails carry their own absolute mountpoints); a host that has nothing
  to lose is best set up again with `jailops-priv init` on the new default.
- `web/*/node_modules` is ignored (a few cache files of it had been committed).

- **A bridge may have any free name, and a network's bridge is named like the network.** `jailops network create
  office --ipv4 10.66.0.1/24 --uplink vmx0 --nat` makes the bridge `office` (and its gateway pair `officega`,
  `officegb`). Without `--bridge` the bridge takes the network's name when it can be one (lowercase letters and
  digits, at most 13 characters, not a driver's form, free on the host and among the networks), else `jo<N>`, and
  `network create` says why in a warning. A `--bridge` that is invalid, too long, a driver's form (`vmx0`, `bridge0`,
  `lo0`) or taken (an interface of the host, or another network's bridge or gateway pair) is refused when the network is
  created, no longer when its first jail starts (that was `forbidden: interface "office" is not managed by JailOps
  (prefix jo)`). The bridge is stored in the spec and keeps its name until the network is deleted, also across a rename
  of the network; `network edit` still refuses to change it. New doctor check `network.bridges` explains an interface
  with a network's name that is not JailOps's.
- **The helper's ownership rule for interfaces changed** ([security-model.md](docs/security-model.md#interfaces)). It
  used to change any interface whose name started with `jo`; it now changes only a bridge or an epair whose description,
  read by the helper from the kernel in the same operation, carries JailOps's marker (`jailops ...`). The helper writes
  the marker when it creates an interface, before the interface has its name, and the rename that gives it the name is
  the kernel's atomic check that the name is free. What stays refused, and is now refused regardless of the name: any
  change to the uplink, `lo0`, a tunnel, a vlan or any interface that is not a bridge or an epair; any change to a bridge
  or epair without the marker (made by hand); writing the marker on an interface that exists, or a description that
  removes it (clearing writes the bare marker `jailops managed`); taking over an interface by its name; creating one
  under a driver's form, loaded or not. Newly refused: the command forms `ifconfig bridge create`, `ifconfig epair
  create` and `ifconfig bridgeN name X` (nothing used them; with them the daemon could rename a hand-made `bridge0` to a
  `jo` name), and an `ifconfig -j`/`route -j` form on an interface of a jail's vnet without the marker. Reading stays
  open.
- **Upgrade:** nothing to do. Interfaces of earlier releases carry their description already. A bridge or epair whose
  name starts with the legacy prefix and that has no description at all (an older build, or a crash between creation and
  description) is accepted once and marked. `if-prefix` in `priv.conf` is deprecated and now only names that legacy
  prefix (default `jo`); `jailops-priv check-config` says so. Existing networks keep their `jo<N>` bridges.
- **Renames.** Networks, address sets, firewall policies, profiles, jails, images and projects can be renamed:
  `jailops network rename lan office`, `jailops firewall address-set|policy rename`, `jailops profile rename`, `jailops
  image rename`, `jailops project rename`, and `jailops jail rename OLD NEW` or `jailops rename OLD NEW` for a stopped jail
  (`POST /api/v1/<kind>/{name}/rename`, extension `rename`, design 8.8). Everything that refers to the object changes in
  the same operation or nothing does: project grants and image lists, jail specs and records, policy rules and set
  includes, profile keys, tunnels, token and certificate scopes, datasets with their mountpoints and properties, PF
  anchors, interface descriptions (a network's interfaces keep their names, its running jails their traffic), update
  history and nightly upgrade runs. The command shows what changes and asks (`-y`, `--dry-run`); `jailops <kind> edit`
  with a new `metadata.name` renames the same way. A running jail, a managed object and app access grants are refused
  with the way out. The console has Rename on the page of each of these objects. An update that changes a name answers
  `invalid` and names the rename.
- **Address sets are created and deleted in the console.** The Address sets tab of the Firewall page has **Add set**
  (name, members, includes, checked as the server checks them), **Delete set** (lists the policies and sets that use it
  and shows the server's refusal) and an empty state; Save is labelled **Save set**.
- Fixed: the Address sets tab could render nothing, or show its list and lose it again, and saving a firewall policy
  failed: the editors copied a reactive object with `structuredClone`, which throws.
- Deleting an address set in use names every policy (or set) that uses it, with a hint and `detail.policies` /
  `detail.sets`.
- Demo: address sets can be created and deleted; a policy in use or mandatory is no longer deleted (the server refuses
  both); a rule's `to` is checked for unknown sets as `from` is.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-11-03

- **New jails come with bash and a coloured prompt** ([shell.md](docs/shell.md)). A new FreeBSD jail gets bash, installed
  from the host's package repository at its first start (`pkg -r ROOT install -y bash`, as an app installation does), as
  the shell of `jailops shell` and the console, and a light blue `user@host:dir#` prompt for every user of the jail, so a
  shell in a jail is recognisable at a glance. The prompt is one file JailOps owns,
  `/usr/local/etc/profile.d/jailops-prompt.sh`, sourced from a marked block at the top of `/usr/local/etc/profile` and
  `/usr/local/etc/bash.bashrc` (the files the FreeBSD bash package reads); all of it lives in the persistent
  `/usr/local` and survives OS updates, and a user's own `~/.bashrc` wins. The keys: `shell` (now also the names `bash`
  and `sh`) and the new `prompt` (`default`, `none` or a PS1 text; written at once into a running jail), `jailops create
  --shell sh` and `--prompt`, the Shell field of the console's jail form, and `jails.shell`, `jails.prompt`,
  `jails.prompt_color` in `jailopsd.yaml` for the defaults. A prompt is checked by an allow-list: nothing in it can run a
  command (no quotes, no backquotes, `$` only as `\$`, only bash's prompt escapes, no `\\` and no octal escapes but
  `\033` and `\007`). Existing jails are not changed: `jailops jail shell-setup NAME` (and **Install bash and the
  prompt** on the console's Console tab) gives one what a new jail gets. A setup that fails (no package repository) does
  not fail the start: it is the jail's `ShellSetup` condition. Linux jails are left alone. The host's green prompt is a
  paste in the same document; JailOps does not edit the host's shell files.
- **A shell session finds what packages installed.** `jailops shell` and the console start the shell with
  `PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin` and `HOME=/root` (before, `/usr/local/bin` was
  missing and HOME unset), and from a terminal `jailops shell` and `jailops exec -t` pass `TERM`, so bash edits lines
  instead of assuming a dumb terminal. The console's terminal draws the 256 colours.
- **Get to a jail and into its shell fast (host console).**
  - **Quick switcher**: `Ctrl+K` (`Cmd+K`), `/` where no text is typed, or the Search button in the side bar (top bar on
    a phone). It finds jails by name, image, address, label (`env=prod`, `team:`, `-tier=edge`) and app, the app catalog,
    images, networks, projects, storage and the console's pages, ranked whole name, prefix, part, anywhere, then letters
    in order; empty, it shows the recent items. **Every project** searches all the projects the identity may use. A jail
    row has its quick actions: Shell (`Shift+Enter`), Logs (`Alt+L`), Start or Stop (`Alt+S`, stop asks first). Keyboard
    and screen reader friendly (dialog, combobox, grouped listbox, results announced), capped per group with "refine your
    search", in memory so thousands of jails stay fast.
  - **Labels you can see and change**: chips in the jail list, on the jail page and in the installed apps; a click
    filters the list. The list's filter reads `key=value`, `key:`, `-key=value` and words, suggests the keys and values the
    jails carry, lives in the address (`/jails?q=env%3Dprod`, shareable, the back button undoes a chip) and is remembered
    per user and project. **Edit labels** on the jail page, **Labels** for the selected jails (set or remove one) and a
    labels field in **Create jail**; each change is a merge patch of `metadata.labels` with the existing `PATCH
    /api/v1/jails/{name}` (admin in the project). The console checks the server's label rules, on the same test cases
    (`sdk/api/testdata/labels.json`, new `TestLabelRulesFixture`). Keys starting with `jailops.` are shown, not edited.
    New page [docs/labels.md](docs/labels.md).
  - **Shell in one click**: a Shell button on every running jail of the list and on the jail page; `/jails/NAME/shell`
    opens the Console tab connected (shareable). A stopped jail offers **Start and open shell** (start, then connect when
    it runs). The Console tab says which shell runs as whom and shows the same shell's command line (`jailops shell NAME
    --project P`) with a copy button. The tab and the buttons are offered only with the `jail_console` extension to an
    operator or admin of the project, the right `jailops exec` needs; nothing changed on the server. A jail page opens on
    the tab used last for that jail.
  - Fixes on the way: a jail page reached from another jail's page (the switcher) shows the new jail, not the old one; on a
    phone the select box of a jail card takes the tap; the terminal's 16 colours are readable on its dark background.

- **An image is one release.** Images are named after their FreeBSD release, `freebsd-15-1` for 15.1-RELEASE; their
  generations are the release's patch levels, made with `jailops image upgrade freebsd-15-1`. A new release is a new
  image (`jailops image create freebsd-15-2 --release 15.2-RELEASE`), created after the host's upgrade; jails stay on
  the image of their release, and moving a jail's data to a jail of a new release is not automated
  ([upgrade.md](docs/upgrade.md#an-image-is-one-release)). The console, the wizard, the hints and the documentation no
  longer propose an alias: jails and apps name the image (`--image freebsd-15-1`, its newest generation). Aliases still
  work for whoever sets them.
- **Nightly auto upgrade per image.** `jailops image auto-upgrade freebsd-15-1 on [--at 03:00] [--no-packages]` (`off`
  stops it), the checkbox **Upgrade automatically every night** on the Images page and in Create image (off until it is ticked:
  nothing is upgraded unless the owner asked), and `spec.auto_upgrade` of `PATCH /api/v1/images/{name}`: every night at the chosen time (the
  host's time zone) the image gets its next generation, its thin jails move to it one at a time with the health check and
  the automatic rollback (the run stops at the first jail that fails), and with packages on the packages inside the jails
  are upgraded. Jails whose update strategy is manual or in place are left alone; a host that was off at that time runs it
  within four hours of coming back. `status.auto_upgrade` holds the next run and the latest runs (ok, unchanged or
  failed, with the jails moved, upgraded and failed), shown by `jailops image show` and on the image's card in the
  console, where a failed run stays as a notice.
- **Package updates of a FreeBSD jail run from the host.** A thin jail is a pkgbase userland without the `pkg` tool, so
  `pkg update` inside it answered "The package management tool is not yet installed": `jailops update check` and
  `update apply` (and the schedules of managed jails) could not upgrade the packages of such a jail. The host now runs
  `pkg -r <jail root>` for the catalog, the dry run and the upgrade, as the app installer does, and refreshes the
  library cache of the jail afterwards. Linux jails still run `apk` inside themselves.
- **Images of a -STABLE, PRERELEASE or -CURRENT release** (`base_latest`) are verified with the key of the ports
  repositories (`/usr/share/keys/pkg`); the release keys (`pkgbase-<major>`) still verify a -RELEASE. Before, building an
  image for 15.2-PRERELEASE failed with "No trusted public keys found". Checked with the whole end-to-end flow on
  FreeBSD 15.2-PRERELEASE.
- The event `image-upgrade-failed` is raised when a nightly run fails.
- **A short command run with a terminal keeps its output.** `jailops exec -t JAIL -- echo hi` printed nothing in 3 to 30%
  of the runs on FreeBSD: the kernel hangs a terminal up when its session leader exits and drops the output not yet read.
  A terminal session now runs under a small leader process of the helper that stays until the output was read, with the
  command in its own foreground process group (signals, resizing and job control work as before). Checked on FreeBSD
  15.2-PRERELEASE: none of 1,500 runs lost output.
- The snapshot ids of the backup repository carry 12 random bits after the microsecond instead of 8 (two jobs of one
  jail that started in the same microsecond collided in a test with a frozen clock; the ZFS snapshot names of a backup
  carry eight random hex digits instead of four).
- **Nothing is upgraded unless it was asked for, and a Debian jail is never touched.** The nightly upgrade is off until
  it is turned on (also in Create image and in the first-run wizard: the box is unticked). `jailops update check` and
  `apply`, the managed schedules and the nightly run drive `pkg` (FreeBSD jails) and `apk` (Alpine jails) only; a Debian
  jail, or any other Linux jail, keeps its own packages (for instance with unattended-upgrades) and JailOps never runs
  `apt` in it.
- **An image upgrade moves the jails that are behind even when it built nothing.** A run that stopped at a failing jail
  left the jails after it on the old generation, and the next run, finding no new packages, skipped them as "the
  package set did not change". They now move to the newest generation (`jailops image upgrade` says so).
- **Package updates upgrade the packages the host names, never the base system.** `pkg -r <root> upgrade` with no names
  would also pull `FreeBSD-*` base packages from the host's FreeBSD-base repository into a jail's root, behind the
  image generation; the base only moves with the generation. Verified on FreeBSD 15.2-PRERELEASE: the nightly run
  moved two jails that were behind and upgraded an outdated package.
- **The console points at a new release.** When the host runs a newer release than its newest FreeBSD image (the host is
  on 15.2, the image is `freebsd-15-1`), the Images page and the Overview say so and open Create image filled in for it.
- **The default image of an app install** is the FreeBSD image of the highest release the host's kernel can run (of two of
  the same release, the first by name), instead of the only image with the alias `stable`. The install dialog and the
  jail form list the images with their release (`freebsd-15-1 (15.1-RELEASE)`).
- **The console creates the base image.** The Images page has **Create image** (FreeBSD, and the Alpine and Debian
  images the API creates): the release defaults to the host's own and nothing older than 15.1 is accepted, the
  architecture is the host's, the name is proposed from the release (`freebsd-15-1` for 15.1-RELEASE, and it follows the
  release until you edit it), and "Build the first generation now" (on by default)
  builds it right after the definition, followed in the dialog as an operation with its progress, a Cancel button and,
  when the build fails, what to check and Try again (the definition is kept and not created twice). An empty Images page
  explains what an image is and offers it first. The first-run wizard has a new step **Base image** after Storage and
  network: it creates and builds `freebsd-15-1` (the host's release, the host's architecture) (or says that
  a FreeBSD image exists), shows the build in the step, and can be skipped; the Done step leads to **Install your first
  app** when an image exists and to **Create the base image** otherwise. The app install dialog and the jail form say in
  place that there is no image and offer the same dialog, instead of a refusal from the server. The existing routes do
  the work (`POST /api/v1/images`, `POST /api/v1/images/{name}/generations`); the build itself is unchanged.
- **The server refuses a FreeBSD image older than 15.1** (the console already did): `image create` and `POST /api/v1/images`
  answer `invalid` for `15.0-RELEASE`, `14.x` or a release the server cannot read, the same floor `jailops doctor` checks for the host.
- `GET /api/v1` reports the host's release as `environment.kernel_version` (`kern.osrelease`; the field existed and was
  always empty). `jailops server info` shows it.
- **Hints for a missing image.** `jailops app install` without any FreeBSD image, and `jailops create` (or the API) with
  an image that does not exist, answer with a hint that names the two commands that make it:
  `jailops image create freebsd-15-1 --release 15.1-RELEASE`, then `jailops image build freebsd-15-1` (the host's
  release; 15.1-RELEASE when the server cannot read it). The empty `jailops image list` names the host's release too
  (it always said 15.1-RELEASE). Before, the hints said "create or import the image first" and
  "name an image with --image".
- `jailops delete NAME --dry-run` on a running jail prints what would be destroyed and that the delete needs `--force` to
  stop it first; before, the dry run failed with `conflict: jail is running` unless `--force` was given too.
- The help of the configuration keys `packages`, `nic.<device>.ingress` and `nic.<device>.egress` says in plain words
  what is not done yet ("Not enforced yet: the limit is stored and reported only, ..."; "Cannot be set when a jail is
  created yet: ..."), in `jailops config keys` and in the console.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-11-02

- **The privileged helper no longer crashes on frames out of order.** A data frame after the end of a request's stream
  (while the request still ran) made `jailops-priv` panic with "send on closed channel" in its connection loop, outside
  the recovery around operations: one bad peer of the helper's socket stopped all jail management on the host. The
  helper now keeps the stream's state with the request and closes only that connection, with a
  `priv.protocol.violation` line in its log (also for an unknown frame kind, data beyond the window, too many acks or
  control frames, and descriptors from a client). Tests send `req`, `end`, `data` over a real socket and random frame
  sequences over a socketpair, and check that a new connection still works.
- **`GET /readyz`**, readiness for load balancers and monitors: `ok` (200) once start-up finished, the helper answers a
  read-only call and the database answers a query; `not ready: CLASS` (503) otherwise, with a fixed class and no
  detail. Public, cached for 2 seconds, not forwarded with `?host=`, left out of the access log. `GET /healthz` is
  unchanged and documented as liveness ([exposure.md](docs/exposure.md#load-balancers-and-monitors)).
- [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md): runbooks (lost admin access, a stolen token or certificate, a compromised
  daemon and what to rotate, a lost backup key, restoring onto a new host, a firewall lock-out, going back one version),
  recovery objectives measured with a restore drill, and what to monitor, with what is not exposed yet (no metrics
  endpoint).

- **Security fixes from an external audit (November 2026)**, reported by [@samarason](https://github.com/samarason) (twelve findings, each checked against the code; the ones that held are fixed here) ([docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md)). **Upgrade:** stop `jailopsd` and `jailops_priv` before `pkg upgrade`, then start the helper first ([upgrade.md](docs/upgrade.md#jailops)).
  - Storage roots: the daemon could mount a dataset of its own on a storage root's directory (`mountpoint` equal to the root's), which replaced its mode 0700 with 0755 and put the jails' setuid programs in reach of its user; a root registered at run time kept the mode it was made with. The helper now refuses a `mountpoint` equal to a root's directory (create, set, clone, receive, encrypted volumes), never unmounts, remounts or moves a root nor changes its `canmount` or `devices`, and gives every root's directory to root with mode 0700 at start, reload and registration (existing roots are closed at the first start). `devices=off` is set on every root and cannot be turned on; a received stream can no longer set `devices`, `setuid` or `exec` (they are inherited; `setuid` stays on in jail roots). A file agent of a restore makes device nodes and setuid or setgid files only in a jail's root or a volume mounted in it; elsewhere it makes no device node and drops the bits, listed as skipped. The rules are one table test, `internal/priv/invariants_test.go`.
  - A storage root's mountpoint may not lie inside a system directory (`/etc`, `/boot`, `/root`, `/usr/local/etc`, `/var/db`, `/var/run`, ...) nor overlap a directory of the helper (`conf-dir`, `host-dir`, `wireguard-dir`, the storage file's directory) in either direction; before, only a root on or above them was refused. `/usr/jails` and the like stay fine.
  - The helper's socket moved to `/var/run/jailops-priv/priv.sock`, a directory of root (mode 0710, group `jailops`): in `/var/run/jailops`, which the daemon writes, its user could put a file or a socket at `priv.sock` and keep the helper from starting. `priv.conf` and `jailopsd.yaml` that name the old path keep working (read as the new one); the rc script makes the directory.
  - Backup node: the first backup session binds an unbound repository to the host's key domain, as the first escrow did. An escrow upload must be an age file. New `jailops-backupd escrow list | escrow delete DOMAIN` and `quarantine add CHUNK` (management API `GET /api/v1/escrow`, `DELETE /api/v1/escrow/{domain}`, `POST /api/v1/quarantine/{id}`, backup-admin, audited) remove a wrong escrow blob or a chunk a host found undecryptable, so it is uploaded again. Documented: hosts that share a node share its key and trust each other ([backup-restore.md](docs/backup-restore.md#who-trusts-whom-hosts-that-share-a-node)).
  - Log forwarding: a sink list set through the API may name its `ca_file` and `token_file` only as plain files directly in the new `logging.secrets_dir` (default `/usr/local/etc/jailops/sinks`, root-owned 0750 `root:jailops`, made by `jailops-priv init`), checked when the list is stored and at every read; before, any root-owned file the daemon's group could read could have its first line sent as a bearer token to a receiver of the caller's choosing. Such a list may not send to loopback, link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`), unspecified, multicast or broadcast addresses or to the daemon's own ports on an address of the host, checked on the resolved address when the socket connects and for an address or `localhost` when the list is stored. Every CA and token file is opened from `/` without following a symbolic link at any component and checked on the open descriptor. The forward test answers a short class of the failure (`connection refused`, `timeout`, `HTTP 503`, `target refused: loopback`, ...), never the receiver's answer. Sinks of `jailopsd.yaml` keep free paths and may name the loopback address; a stored list from before naming files elsewhere stops delivering until it is changed or reset.
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` only while the served certificate comes from ACME or was uploaded or configured and verifies against the host's roots; before, it was sent with the self-signed certificate too, which a browser that kept it would then refuse without a way to click through. Both consoles send a `Permissions-Policy` that turns off camera, microphone, location and the other device features; the backup node sends no `Strict-Transport-Security` (its certificate is self-signed and pinned).
  - `jailops-priv setup-token` prints only a token of the expected shape (52 base32 characters), only console addresses of the form `https://HOST:PORT/` in printable ASCII, and the hint with control, bidirectional and zero-width characters replaced: what the daemon answers reaches root's terminal and the system console.
  - Tests for what the audit found already closed: a token in the query string authenticates no exec upgrade or console route, and at most 16 file agents run at once (one more answers `busy`).
  - CI: every apt mirror of the web end-to-end job is an `https` URL. [ci-supply-chain.md](docs/ci-supply-chain.md) lists the third-party actions and how to pin them to commits.

- **Security fixes from a review of the API, the console and the CLI** ([docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md)).
  - Logins: every attempt is counted before its password is checked (a burst from one source ran as many 64 MiB argon2id checks at once as it sent requests), at most four checks run at once for the daemon (32 waiting, then `rate_limited` at once), a locked-out source costs no check, and an IPv6 source is its /64 for every limiter. Guesses for one account from many sources wait 1 s, 2 s ... up to 30 s each after 10 failures (slowed, never locked).
  - Audit log: one function escapes (control, bidirectional and zero-width characters, invalid UTF-8) and cuts every entry (object 256 bytes, detail 4096, 256 for an anonymous caller); a failed login no longer records the typed user name; refusals of a locked-out source are one entry per minute with a count. **New configuration** `audit.retention` (default `90d`) and `audit.max_entries` (default 1000000), pruned daily; the newest 1000 entries are never deleted (a database trigger replaces the one that refused every delete; migration 0003). Durations in `jailopsd.yaml` accept whole days (`90d`).
  - Every API answer is `Cache-Control: no-store` (the check compared four bytes of the path with a seven-byte string and never matched).
  - Sessions: only a global admin sees and ends other users' sessions (a global reader could). Event streams, console output and exec sessions end at the next keepalive when their token, certificate, user or session is revoked, disabled or changed; at most 16 event streams per identity (`rate_limited`). Console sessions belong to the kind and name of the credential and to their project; their ids are no longer in the request log or audit objects.
  - **API strictness**: request bodies refuse unknown members, members in other cases, duplicates and data after the value (`invalid`, naming the member); a misspelled `dry_run` ran the change for real. The `status` of an object sent back is ignored; maps and merge patches are unchanged. A client that sends a field this version does not know (a newer client through a hub to an older host) now gets `invalid`.
  - Labels: keys of letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.` (up to 63, with an optional prefix and `/`), values up to 253 bytes of printable text, at most 64 per object; descriptions and comments refuse control and invisible characters and are at most 4096 bytes (`invalid`). Stored labels are checked when they change.
  - **Anonymous `GET /api/v1`** answers only `api_version`, `api_extensions`, `role` and `auth`; the host name, host UUID, software version, environment and secrets recipient need an identity. `doctor` shows the text of failing checks to global admins only. `?access_token=` on `/api/v1/events` is no longer accepted (nothing used it). `POST /api/v1/auth/totp` (start) and `POST /api/v1/auth/recovery-codes` need `{"password": ...}`.
  - `jailops`: every string a server sends is cleaned before the terminal sees it (tables, show, errors and hints, audit, doctor, events, labels); `remote add` prints the fingerprint first and quotes the certificate's subject and issuer; `exec` and `shell` end and restore the terminal on SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP. `wireguard join` takes `--token-file` and warns about a token given as an argument.
  - Web console: the console embedded in `jailopsd` ignores `?demo` (demo mode is a build-time flag, `JAILOPS_DEMO_BUILD=1`, which the end-to-end tests use) and shows a demo banner on the login page of a demo build; an API token is forgotten on a 401.
  - Regression tests adopted from the review: a cross-project leak detector over every GET route, the event stream and every mutating route, and a check that token, session and client certificate decide every route alike.

- **Security fixes from a review of the appliance release.**
  - The helper's file operations (`fs.read_file`, `fs.write_file`, `fs.mkdir`, `fs.remove`, `fs.remove_all`, `fs.copy_tree`, `fs.seed_keys`) open a path below a jail's tree (its `root`, `root.new`, `root.old`, `root.stale`, a volume `data/<v>`, or an image generation) at that tree, reached from the storage mount one plain directory at a time with a check of device and inode, instead of at the whole storage mount. A relative symlink made inside a jail no longer leads into another jail or project of the same storage root (it did: `app allow` could read and write another jail's `pg_hba.conf`, an app draft could read another jail's `rc.conf`); one that stays inside is followed as before, and an absolute symlink is refused, as before. The path arguments of allow-listed commands below a jail's tree must resolve inside it too.
  - Pid files: daemon(8) writes them as root, so they moved out of `/var/run/jailops` (writable by the group `jailops`) into `/var/run`: `jailops-priv.pid`, `jailops-priv-daemon.pid`, `jailopsd.pid`, `jailopsd-daemon.pid`, and for the backup node `jailops-backupd.pid` and `jailops-backupd-daemon.pid` (out of the node user's directory). The sockets stay where they are. The helper's own `-pidfile` no longer writes through a symlink. **Upgrading**: stop `jailopsd` and `jailops_priv` (and `jailops_backupd`) before installing this version, since the new scripts look for the pid files in the new place.
  - WireGuard routes are checked by the helper: inside the allowed IPs of a peer of the tunnel, at least a /8 (IPv4) or /16 (IPv6), clear of loopback, link-local, multicast, the host's own addresses, its default gateways and its resolvers. Before, only `/0` was refused, so a tunnel could take the host's traffic with `0.0.0.0/1` and `128.0.0.0/1` although `admin-routes` was off. New `priv.conf` key `wireguard-routes` lists networks allowed anyway; `admin-routes` lifts the checks except the one of the allowed IPs. A full-tunnel client now needs one of the two.
  - A host restore (and a revert of a pending change, also at boot) puts back only what the module owns: whole `resolv.conf` and `pf.conf`, the jailops block of `ntp.conf`, and the module's own `rc.conf` variables, set or removed with `sysrc -x`. Snapshots no longer copy `rc.conf`; they record those variables. Before, the whole `rc.conf` and `ntp.conf` went back and undid what root had changed since; the restore diff showed lines of `rc.conf` the module does not own. A snapshot of 0.5.0 gives only the module's variables from its copy.
  - First-run setup: a global admin API token or client certificate that has not expired closes the setup like a user (before, only users counted, so every start of `jailopsd` printed a usable setup token on a host administered by tokens). A setup token left over is removed as soon as an administrator exists. Deleting or demoting the last global administrator (user, token or certificate) is refused with `conflict` while no other one exists; root on the socket stays the recovery access.
  - Log reads open `var/log` of a jail one directory at a time and compare it with what was checked, so swapping it for a symlink between the check and the open cannot point a read at the rest of the jail's root.
  - The helper limits wrong passphrases of encrypted volumes itself (five per volume, twenty for all, then a wait from 30 seconds doubling to an hour, `rate_limited`), not only the daemon.
  - Audit details quote and cut (200 bytes) the values a client sent (the source, ports and database of `app allow` and `deny`, log sink names, ACME domains), also for refused requests.
  - A failed `app allow` after psql made the role keeps the role in the registry (marked unfinished), so the next allow sets a new password and finishes instead of refusing a role "not made by JailOps".
  - The generated self-signed key is written atomically with mode 0600 (no write through a symlink); `jailops_pool` and `-pool` refuse a name that starts with `-`; the reference catalog's mail app starts Dovecot with `disable_plaintext_auth = yes` (no password in clear before TLS) and its notes say so.
  - Documented: what a global admin can point log sinks and the ACME directory at ([security-model.md](docs/security-model.md#log-forwarding)), and that volume ownership rests on the `jailops:managed` and `jailops:kind` user properties ([storage.md](docs/storage.md#encrypted-volumes)).

- **The appliance path: one rc.conf switch, a first start without a shell** ([docs/install.md](docs/install.md#the-appliance-path), [docs/appliance.md](docs/appliance.md)).
  - `jailops_appliance="YES"` in `/etc/rc.conf` (with `jailops_appliance_modules`, default all modules, and `jailops_pool`) turns host management on in both programs: the rc script of `jailops_priv` passes `-appliance-modules` to the helper, which manages `host-manage` of `priv.conf` and these together (read at start only; not a key of `priv.conf`; `check-config` prints both lists), and the rc script of `jailopsd` passes the same list to the daemon (`host.manage.modules` and these). The helper's list still decides: the daemon cannot switch itself on. Doctor check `appliance` (ok when both agree, a warning with the line to fix otherwise).
  - First start: without `priv.conf`, the rc script runs the new `jailops-priv appliance-init`, the setup of `init` on `jailops_pool` or the pool of the root file system, refusing a pool that holds another JailOps dataset and logging every command to syslog. `jailops-priv revert-pending` does nothing before the helper is set up.
  - **Setup token** (extension `setup`): `POST /api/v1/setup/token` (root on the socket) issues a one-time token (32 random bytes, base32, 24 hours, stored as its SHA-256 in `<state_dir>/setup/token.json`), `GET /api/v1/setup` tells anyone that an administrator is missing, `POST /api/v1/setup` with the token creates the first global administrator and uses the token up; wrong tokens are locked out per source like failed logins; every setup route answers `not_found` once an administrator exists. `jailops-priv setup-token [-wait D] [-syslog]` asks the daemon for one and prints it with the console's addresses (exit 3 once set up); the rc script of `jailopsd` runs it after every start in appliance mode and writes it to `/dev/console` and syslog `authpriv` (`/var/log/auth.log`), never to the daemon's own log. `jailopsd` now requires `syslogd` in its rc order. SDK `SetupStatus`, `Setup`, `SetupToken`.
  - The console's **first-run wizard** (`/setup`, shown instead of the login while no administrator exists): the account with the token, the host name, resolvers and NTP, the certificate, the host firewall (ssh only from the browser's address, commit confirmed), storage, a managed network and a project when none exist, and a link to the app catalog; every step but the account can be skipped. Demo `?demo=setup`.
- **The console's certificate: upload, and ACME** ([docs/exposure.md](docs/exposure.md)) (extension `host_certificate`, kind `HostCertificate`).
  - `GET /api/v1/host/certificate` (the served certificate: subject, names, issuer, validity, fingerprint, whether a public CA signed it, the ACME state, the redirect, the `jailops remote add` command, without a fingerprint for a public certificate), `PUT` uploads a PEM chain and key (checked: the chain parses and is in order, the key matches and is not encrypted, valid now, for server authentication and for the host name given; written to `<data_dir>/tls/uploaded.{crt,key}`, 0600, atomically), `POST .../acme`, `POST .../self-signed`. The choice is kept in `<data_dir>/tls/choice.json`; `listen.https.cert`/`key` of the file still win and cannot be changed from the API. Trust tokens pin the certificate served when they are issued. SDK `c.HostSystem().Certificate()`.
  - **ACME** with `golang.org/x/crypto/acme` (already a dependency): `listen.https.acme` (`enabled`, `email`, `domains`, `directory_url` with the production directory by default, `challenge` `http-01` or `tls-alpn-01`, `accept_tos`, which must be true, `challenge_address`, default `:39080`), or the console. The daemon answers http-01 on its challenge listener (plain http, challenge tokens only) and tls-alpn-01 on its TLS listener; the host redirects port 80 or 443 to it: the host firewall module renders the `rdr` and `pass` rules from two validated values (`acme` of the firewall spec, filled in by the daemon), otherwise the console prints the two `rdr pass` lines. Daily check with jitter, renewal 30 days before expiry, backoff of 1 h doubling to a day after failures, the new certificate served from the next handshake on; keys and certificate in `<data_dir>/tls/acme` (0700/0600). Doctor `tls.certificate` and `tls.acme` (days left, the last error, the redirect, a self-check of the challenge listener). No dns-01, so no wildcard certificates. Tested against an ACME CA written in the tests; UNVERIFIED with a real CA (the staging check is in docs/exposure.md).
  - Console: a Certificates panel on the Host page (the current certificate, Upload, Request with ACME with the CA's terms, Use self-signed again with a warning) and the right `jailops remote add` command in Access for a public certificate.
- `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh`: a block behind `JAILOPS_E2E_APPLIANCE=1` (off by default): the rc switch on a test configuration, `check-config` and doctor `appliance`, the setup token flow with curl, a certificate upload served to `openssl s_client`, and the refusals of ACME settings, restoring `rc.conf` at the end. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.

- **The command line after a usability review** (changes that scripts see are marked **scripts**).
  - **scripts:** `jailops delete` (and `jail delete`, `delete --all`, `delete -l`) is a data-loss action: before anything is deleted it shows, read from the server, the size of each jail's root and data, its volumes and its number of snapshots, and asks for the jail's name typed (the project name for several). `-y` no longer answers it; scripts pass `--confirm-data-loss`. A running jail without `--force` is refused before the question; `--force` still stops it first and confirms nothing. `--dry-run` shows the same summary, and a missing jail is `not_found` in a dry run too (every kind's `delete --dry-run` checks that the object exists).
  - **scripts:** `user set-role` keeps what is not given: `--projects` alone keeps the role, `--role` alone keeps the scope (it used to fall back to `readonly`); it prints the role and scope before and after.
  - **scripts:** `--role` is the flag of `token create`, `cert create`, `user create`, `user set-role` and `trust add`; `--permission` stays accepted as a hidden alias. Tables say `ROLE` where they said `PERMISSION`; the API fields keep their names (`permission`).
  - **scripts:** `app export` writes its file with `--to FILE`; `-o` is the output format there too (`-o json` or `-o yaml` prints the draft as data). `-o NAME.yaml` (or `.yml`), the former spelling, still writes the file and prints a deprecation warning.
  - **scripts:** `logs forward remove` and `logs forward reset` ask for confirmation (`-y` answers it). Their confirmations read `log-sink/NAME added|updated|removed` and `log-forward reset: ...` like the other commands.
  - **scripts:** `not_managed` exits 6 (like `unsupported`) instead of 3.
  - **scripts:** a daemon that cannot be reached prints `unavailable: cannot reach jailopsd at SOCKET (reason)` (or the URL and remote name) with a hint (`service jailopsd status` for the local socket) instead of the raw transport error; a missing input file no longer gets the socket hint. The exit status stays 1.
  - **scripts:** `exec` reads its flags anywhere before `--` (`jailops exec web --project shop -- ls`); only the jail name may stand before `--` with them. Without `--` the first word after the name starts the command as before, and a first word that starts with `-` is refused with the right form.
  - **scripts:** `network grant` and `network revoke` take the project from the global `--project`, `JAILOPS_PROJECT` or the current project (their own required `--project` hid the global one).
  - `jailops host certificate show|acme|upload|self-signed` (extension `host_certificate`): the served certificate with its subject, names, issuer, expiry, fingerprint and source, the ACME state and the exact `jailops remote add` command; ACME with `--domain`, `--email`, `--challenge`, `--staging`, `--accept-tos`; upload with `--cert`, `--key`, `--hostname`; back to self-signed after the name of the replaced certificate is typed (`--i-know` for a script). docs/exposure.md uses these commands; the curl form stays as one line. The fake serves the four routes.
  - `jailops audit --limit` works (it was in the help but not a flag), with `--since DURATION` and `--user NAME` (sent to the server) and `--action PATTERN` (matched by the client over the server's 1000 newest entries). SDK `AuditFiltered` and `AuditFilter`.
  - `jail create` without `--network` or `--storage` (and without a profile) takes the project's only network or storage, as `app install` does, and says which on standard error; several grants are never guessed from. `api.ProjectSpec.SoleNetwork` and `SoleStorage` are the one rule for both.
  - Error hints: an `invalid` error no longer gets a generic hint; `not_found` names the list command of the kind (`jailops jail list`, `jailops op list`, ...); `conflict` gets the read-again hint only for a change made meanwhile; `forbidden` for a network or storage that is not granted names `jailops network grant NET --project P` or `jailops project set P --storage NAME` (from the server). Server messages name the CLI flag: quotas ask for `--cpu`, `--memory`, `--pids`; sizes, CPU and image references name `--memory`, `--disk`, `--cpu`, `--image`.
  - The vocabulary: `-l` and `--selector` (and `--label`) are accepted wherever a selector is (lists, start/stop/restart/delete, logs, log sinks, `backup policy create`, which also gets `-l`); `trust add --expires` (`--ttl` stays a hidden alias); `--password-file FILE|-` for `user create` and `user set-password`, `--passphrase-file -` and `remote add --token-file -` read standard input. A trust token given to the two-argument `remote add NAME URL` is refused with the one-argument command that joins.
  - `show` of storage, networks, images and projects prints a short human form with sizes in units (no raw bytes, no generation counter); `-o yaml`/`json` are unchanged. An empty list says `No jails in project P. Create one with: ...` with the kind's create command; a filtered one says `No jails in project P match.`.
  - Lists: `-c` and `--sort` accept every column the kind has (the short terminal form's too, such as `ipv4`), the error and the help list them, and the generic example uses columns each kind has.
  - Every example of the help runs: a test parses each example line against the command tree and runs it with `--dry-run` against the fake (a capitalised word or `...` is a placeholder). The failing examples (`-c name,age` on kinds without an age, `token create`, `cert create` and `user create` without a scope) are fixed.
  - Help and man pages: the root help and every man page have ENVIRONMENT (with `JAILOPS_PROJECT`, `JAILOPS_OUTPUT`, `JAILOPS_EDITOR`) and EXIT STATUS sections; the "a project is required" hint names `JAILOPS_PROJECT`; `explain` tells the confirmation flags apart (`-y`, `--confirm-data-loss`, `--i-know`, `--force`) and completes error codes; `--image` completes `NAME@alias`; confirmations that get no answer say that standard input gave none; the `(admin)` markers left the one-line descriptions (the long text says what role a command needs). jailops-priv(8) documents its one-dash flags.
  - docs/install.md: the kernel modules are the ones doctor checks (`if_bridge`, `if_epair`, `pf`, `zfs`), the token is created after the project it is scoped to, the storage `default` is explained before it is used, `vtnet0` is the uplink of the example, root is assumed instead of `sudo` (not in the base system), the appliance path has four commands and a browser, and remote access uses the one-argument `remote add HOST --token-stdin --name NAME` that redeems a trust token (also in docs/exposure.md; a test runs this sequence). `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh` and `ci-freebsd-pf.sh` delete jails with `--confirm-data-loss`, export with `--to`, answer the sink removal with `-y`, and check the delete summary, the exec flag order, the create defaults and the certificate commands.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-11-02

- **The logs of all jails, and forwarding them** ([docs/logging.md](docs/logging.md)).
  - `jailops logs` without a jail merges the end of `messages` (or `--file`) of every jail of the project into one stream ordered by the timestamp each line starts with (RFC 3339, RFC 5424, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, `Mon DD HH:MM:SS` in the current year or the one before, the bracketed web form); a line without one keeps its place after the line before it. Each line starts with `jail/file`, coloured per jail on a terminal; `--jail` and `-l KEY=VALUE` (repeatable), `--app`, `--app-logs` (the files installed apps declare below `/var/log`), `--all-projects`, `--tail`, `--since`, `--grep` per file, `-f` follows all of them, `-o json` prints one `{time, project, jail, app, file, line}` per line. A file that cannot be read (a jail that is not mounted) is named on standard error. `jailops logs NAME [FILE]` is still the one jail's logs; a jail named `forward` is read with `jailops jail logs forward`.
  - New route `GET /api/v1/logs` (extension `logs_unified`, operator in every project read, audited once per identity and selection every five minutes): the per-jail reads of up to 50 files, merged, at most 2000 lines, with a `next` map of offsets per file sent back as `cursor` to follow. Types `LogsQuery`, `LogsRead`, `LogEntry`, `LogSource`; `c.Logs().Read` in the SDK and the fake.
  - **Forwarding**: `jailopsd` sends the same files (default `messages` of every jail plus the logs installed apps declare; narrowed by project, jail and label, with exclusions) and, on request, its audit log to sinks: RFC 5424 syslog over udp, tcp or tls (octet-counted frames, facility `local0` to `local7`, APP-NAME `jailops`, structured data `[jailops project="" jail="" app="" file=""]`, the line escaped and cut at 8 KiB) and https webhooks (JSON lines, a bearer token read from a root-owned file at each delivery). TLS is always verified (the host's roots or `ca_file`); a plain sink to a remote address carries a warning. One loop per sink reads through the helper's `fs.tail_file` only (no new helper operation), keeps a bounded queue (default 10,000 lines, the oldest dropped and counted), retries with exponential backoff and jitter, and saves per-file offsets in the database: at least once across restarts, starting over after a rotation; a new sink starts at the end of the files. No new dependency.
  - The sinks are `logging.forward` of `jailopsd.yaml` unless a global admin stores a list (state kind `LogForward`, extension `log_forward`): `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/v1/logs/forward` (`PUT` with `If-Match`; `DELETE` returns to the file) and `POST /api/v1/logs/forward/test`. `jailops logs forward list|add|edit|remove|test|status|reset` (`add syslog --to tls://logs.example.com:6514 --facility local3 [--ca FILE] [--jail NAME]... [-l K=V]...`, `--dry-run`, completion), `c.Logs().Forward`, `SetForward`, `ResetForward`, `TestForward` in the SDK and the fake (`SeedLogForward`, `SeedLogSinkStatus`, `SeedLogSinkTestFailure`). `jailops doctor` reports `logs.forward` (warn when a sink has failed for more than five minutes).
  - The host console has a **Logs** page (`/logs`): filters for project (or all), jails, app, text and time window, the file and app logs, a live follow, a colour chip per jail and the files that could not be read; a **Forwarding** tab for a global admin lists the sinks with their state and adds, edits, tests and removes them, or returns to the file's list. The Logs tab of a jail links to it.
  - `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh` starts a tcp listener on the host, adds a syslog sink with the CLI, logs a line with `logger` in a jail and checks that it arrives with the jail in the structured data, then removes the sink. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.
- **Host firewall (appliance module 2) and commit confirmed** ([docs/appliance.md](docs/appliance.md)). Off by default: with `firewall` in both `host.manage.modules` of `jailopsd.yaml` and `host-manage` of `priv.conf`, and only then, JailOps owns `/etc/pf.conf` as a whole file (and `pf_enable`, `pf_rules`); a host without the module keeps today's behaviour exactly.
  - The privileged helper renders the file itself from a validated `HostFirewallSpec` (template `default`, `open` or `custom-rules`; ssh ports and sources; console sources, the port being the daemon's TLS port; up to 64 `allow` rows of proto, ports, sources and a comment; address sets as pf tables; `icmp`; `logging`; `nat: none`): the three anchor lines of design 5.2 (`anchor "jailops/*"` first among the filter rules), loopback, neighbour discovery, router advertisements, path MTU discovery and ICMP errors always, `block in all` for the rest. It checks the text with `pfctl -n -f -`, refuses a ruleset that would shut out the caller's address (the daemon passes the peer address; unknown on the unix socket and through a hub, then `i_know` is needed), keeps a snapshot (the first apply keeps the administrator's own file, reason `adopt`), writes and loads the file and turns pf on when it was off. Golden files for the renderer, refusal tests over the wire for every field.
  - **Commit confirmed**, generic in the helper: a risky change writes and syncs `<host-dir>/pending.json` (id, module, snapshot, deadline) before it touches the host; the helper's own timer reverts it at the deadline (`--confirm-within`, default 120 s, 10 s to 30 min) unless it is confirmed. One change waits at a time; any other host change answers `busy` naming it. The helper re-arms the timer at start, or reverts at once when the deadline passed; the new rc.d script `jailops_revert` (`BEFORE: netif pf jailops_priv`) runs `jailops-priv revert-pending` at boot, so a reboot never keeps an unconfirmed change. How the last change ended is kept (`confirmed`, `reverted`, `timed_out`, `reverted_at_boot`, `revert_failed`).
  - Helper: five new operations, `host.firewall.read`, `host.firewall.apply` (admin, `host-manage = firewall`), `host.pending.read`, `host.pending.confirm` (admin, the module), `host.pending.revert` (admin); its own six `pfctl` forms (`-n -f -`, `-f /etc/pf.conf`, `-e`, `-d`, `-s info`, `-s rules`), none reachable through `run.exec`; `sysrc` accepts `pf_enable=YES` and `pf_rules=/etc/pf.conf` only. `host.snapshot.restore` now needs the module of the snapshot.
  - API (extensions `host_firewall`, `host_pending`): `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/host/firewall` (kind `HostFirewall`), `GET /api/v1/host/pending`, `POST /api/v1/host/pending/confirm`, `POST /api/v1/host/pending/revert`; `HostChange` gains `pending`, `rules` and `warnings` (additive). SDK `c.HostSystem().Firewall()` (`Get`, `Apply`), `Pending`, `Confirm`, `Revert`; the fake serves them (`fake.WithHostFirewall()`).
  - CLI: `jailops host firewall show|set|apply -f FILE|diff`, `jailops host pending|confirm [--id]|revert [--id]`, with `--dry-run`, `--confirm-within` and `--i-know`.
  - Doctor: `host.firewall` (not managed; enabled on one side; a change waiting for its confirmation; drift of `/etc/pf.conf`, `pf_enable` or `pf_rules`).
  - Console: a Firewall section on the Host page (rules, an editor with inline validation, Preview with the diff, Apply with the confirmation window explained, a warning while ssh is open to the world) and a banner on every page while a change waits, with a countdown and Confirm and Revert, also after a reload.
  - `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh`: with `JAILOPS_E2E_HOSTFW=1` (off by default, CI does not set it) it keeps the ssh port open to the `SSH_CLIENT` address, applies with `--confirm-within 20` and lets it revert, applies and confirms, then restores the original `pf.conf` through the snapshot and checks it byte for byte, with an EXIT trap that puts the original back. UNVERIFIED on FreeBSD: the rendered file with the real `pfctl`, a host whose pf was disabled, IPv6 sources, and the boot order of `jailops_revert`.
- **Encrypted volumes** ([docs/storage.md](docs/storage.md#encrypted-volumes)): a volume can be encrypted at rest with native ZFS encryption, chosen when the jail is created (`--volume NAME:MOUNT:encrypted[:QUOTA]`, `encrypted: true` on a volume of a spec). The volume is its own encryption root (`aes-256-gcm`, `keyformat=passphrase`, `keylocation=prompt`); one passphrase per jail, 12 to 512 bytes, asked twice without echo or read from `--passphrase-file` (never an argument). After every host boot the jail is **locked** (state `locked`, `status.locked`), a start is refused with the new error code `locked` (409, hint `jailops jail unlock NAME`) and the boot skips it; `jailops jail unlock NAME [--start]` loads the keys and starts a jail that was due for autostart. `jailops jail lock NAME` stops the jail and unloads the keys; `jailops jail passphrase NAME` changes the passphrase (`zfs change-key`, the old one checked first). A wrong passphrase answers `bad_passphrase` (403); five in a row lock a jail's unlocks out for 30 seconds. Copies of an encrypted volume are raw sends (still encrypted, same passphrase, locked). A backup skips a locked volume (`skipped: locked: volume NAME` among the run's warnings); a restore makes a plain volume and its preflight says so. The encryption of a volume cannot change later; encrypted storages and whole jails stay unsupported. API extension `volume_unlock`: `volume_passphrase` in `POST /api/v1/jails` (`JailCreate`), `POST /api/v1/jails/{name}/unlock` (operator), `.../lock` (operator), `.../passphrase` (admin); `Jails().CreateWithPassphrase`, `Unlock`, `Lock`, `ChangePassphrase` in the SDK and the fake (which records request bodies with passphrases replaced, and has `RebootHost`). The passphrase reaches the helper on the request stream of five new typed operations (`zfs.create_encrypted`, `zfs.load_key`, `zfs.unload_key`, `zfs.change_key`, and the read-only `zfs.feature_state`; `zfs.replicate` takes `raw`), which accept only an encrypted volume of a JailOps jail, and `zfs` on standard input: it is in no argument vector, reply, operation, journal, audit entry or log line, and tests search all of them for it. Doctor: `volumes.locked` (info, the jails waiting for a passphrase) and `volumes.encryption` (`feature@encryption` of each storage pool). The host console has an Unlock dialog (no echo, a show/hide toggle, nothing kept), a Lock button, a Change passphrase dialog (admin), a locked chip in the jail list and on the jail page, a dashboard banner counting locked jails, and a volume (optionally encrypted) in the create form; the demo has a locked jail `vault` (passphrase `demo-vault-passphrase`). `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh` has an `encrypted volume` block (skipped when the pool lacks the feature). UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-30

- **Interfaces say what they are.** Every interface JailOps makes carries a short description that `ifconfig` shows: `jailops net=<network> bridge`, `jailops net=<network> gateway (bridge side)` and `(host side)`, `jailops jail=<project>/<jail> net=<network> (host side)` and `(jail side)` (the jail end is described from the host inside the jail's vnet), `jailops wireguard=<name>`. At most 64 characters of `A-Za-z0-9 ._:/=()-`, built from names only, cut with `..` when a name is long (golden-tested). The reconcile loop repairs a missing or different description of an interface JailOps owns (a jail's epairs by their name, the jail end once per start; a network's bridge and gateway pair when they carry its text or the `jailops:<uuid>` marker of earlier releases, which is replaced) and touches no other; a bridge without a description is still not taken. Orphaned epairs are now matched to jails by name. `jailops doctor` reports `net.descriptions`. The helper's `net.set_description` accepts only `jailops ...` texts of that character set, and the command rules accept two more forms, `ifconfig -j <jail> <if>` (read) and `ifconfig -j <jail> <if> description <JailOps text>`. API extension `interface_descriptions`. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.
- **WireGuard tunnels** ([docs/wireguard.md](docs/wireguard.md)): a new kind `WireGuard` (`/api/v1/wireguard`, extension `wireguard`; operator reads, admin changes) for a server and its peers or a client. `jailops wireguard create NAME --address CIDR [--network NET] [--endpoint HOST:PORT]`, `peer add SERVER PEER [--address A] [--keepalive N] [--format token|conf]` (keys made on the host, the next free pool address, applied at once, a join token `jwg1.<base64url(JSON)>` printed once), `join TOKEN|-` (a client in one command), `peer list|show|remove`, `list`, `show`, `status` (handshake, transfer, endpoint per peer), `up`, `down`, `rotate-keys`, `edit`, `delete`; `--dry-run` everywhere. Private and preshared keys are made and kept by the helper in `wireguard-dir` (`/var/db/jailops-priv/wireguard`, root, 0700, files 0600) and never reach a command line, the API, the audit log or a log; the configuration reaches the kernel with `wg syncconf` of a 0600 file the helper removes. Seven typed helper operations (`wg.keys`, `wg.peer_keys`, `wg.import`, `wg.apply`, `wg.remove`, `wg.show`, `wg.tools`), the admin assertion for every change, `if_wg` on the module list. The reconcile loop recreates the interfaces after a reboot. A server with `networks` gets the pf anchor `jailops/wg.<name>`; the rule for the listen port stays in your `pf.conf` (printed as `firewall_rule`). `jailops doctor`: `wireguard.tools` (the wg program at `/usr/bin/wg` or `/usr/local/bin/wg`, `pkg install wireguard-tools`), `wireguard.forwarding`, `wireguard.firewall`. The host console has a WireGuard tab under Networks (create a server, add a peer with the token shown once and a `.conf` download, join by token, peers with their last handshake and transfer). Fleet sync declares servers and their peers' public parts (`hosts/<host>/wireguard/`). `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh` runs a server, a peer and a client on one host when `if_wg` and `wg` are there and says SKIP otherwise. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.
- **Who may connect to an installed app** (`docs/apps.md`, "Who may connect"). An app is **closed** after its installation: a new last firewall step, `close-firewall`, gives the jail the managed policy `app-<jail>` (`managed_by: app-access`, default deny, after the health check). Apps installed before stay open until their first allow, which closes them.
  - `jailops app allow APP from SOURCE [--port N[/proto]]... [--db NAME] [--rotate] [--dry-run]`, `jailops app deny APP from SOURCE [--drop-role] [--dry-run]` and `jailops app access [APP]`. SOURCE is `@jail`, `@project/jail` (needs the other project too), `@address-set`, an address or prefix, or `host` (the gateway addresses the host connects from); the shell completes them. One rule per protocol in the managed policy, rendered after the project's mandatory policy and before the jail's own; the firewall routes refuse to change or delete a managed policy (`forbidden`).
  - A definition may carry an optional `access:` block (`type: postgresql`, `port`, `service`, `hba_file`; strict, new keys are invalid for older daemons). For such an app an allow makes a role and a database (`--db`, default the source jail's name; `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,62}$`), with `psql` run as `postgres` in the jail and the statements on stdin; the server gets a SCRAM-SHA-256 verifier of a generated 32-character password, never the password; a managed block of `pg_hba.conf` (`# jailops access begin`/`end`, one `host DB ROLE PREFIX scram-sha-256` line per address) is written through the helper and reloaded; `listen_addresses` is set once (one restart). The connection string `postgres://ROLE:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DB?sslmode=disable` is in the answer once and stored nowhere; `--rotate` makes a new one. Deny removes the rule and the lines and takes the login of a role JailOps made (or drops it with `--drop-role`, its objects given to postgres, the database kept); a role JailOps did not make is never touched. The reference copy of `postgresql` has the block; the catalog's definition gets it in the packages repository.
  - New routes `GET`/`POST /api/v1/jails/{name}/access` and `POST .../access/deny` (readonly, operator, operator; audited; answered at once, not as operations), types `AppAccess`, `AppAllow`, `AppAllowResult`, `AppDeny`, `AppDenyResult`, `AppAccessDef`, state kind `AppAccess` (the registry of grants and of the roles JailOps made, no password), extension `app_access`, `Apps().Access`, `Allow`, `Deny` in the SDK and the fake, `SeedAppGrant`. Doctor reports `apps.access` (warn) when a grant's rule or `pg_hba.conf` line is missing or its source jail is gone.
  - The host console has an **Access** tab on the page of an installed app: the grants with their rules, anchor lines and `pg_hba.conf` lines, an Allow dialog (a searchable list of the project's jails, address sets, an address field, the host, a database name) that shows the connection string once with a copy button, and Deny with a confirmation.
  - `jailops-sync` declares apps (`App`) and their grants (`AppAccess`); see `docs/fleet-sync.md` and `examples/app-access-fleet`.
  - `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh`: every check that connects from the host first allows the host; the nginx block checks that the page is refused before; `JAILOPS_E2E_APPS=postgresql-access` installs PostgreSQL, allows one jail, connects from it with the printed string, is refused from another, and checks the closure after a deny. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.
- **Rate limits say they are not enforced**: a jail whose `nic` sets `ingress` or `egress` carries a warning in `status.warnings` ("stored but not enforced yet"), `jailops config set` prints it, and doctor reports `jails.rate_limits` with the new status `info` (counted as ok; `jailops doctor` prints `INFO`). No shaper was built.
- `scripts/ci-freebsd-pf.sh` phase 11 checks a port forward (`redirect` of a policy rule) from a client on the uplink's network to the jail, and that a port that is not forwarded stays closed. UNVERIFIED until it has run on a host.

- **Write your own app** (`docs/apps.md`, a new section with the whole loop and a worked example, memcached): try an app on a host, turn it into a definition, send it to the packages repository.
  - `jailops app new NAME [--package PKG[,PKG...]] [--service NAME] [--port N[/proto]] [--category C] [--dir DIR] [--force]` writes `DIR/NAME.yaml` offline: every key of the format with a short comment on what it does and the usual traps (`pkg -r` and the owners of a package user's directories, `ldconfig`, `sysvipc`, the start wrapper), prefilled from the flags, with `TODO` markers where a person decides. The file parses and validates as it is. It also writes `NAME.svg`, a neutral placeholder icon, unless one is there, and refuses to write over `NAME.yaml` without `--force`. `-o json` reports the files and the marked lines.
  - `jailops app export JAIL [--project P] [-o FILE] [--force]` drafts a definition from a running FreeBSD jail and writes it, commented, to `FILE` or the standard output (`-o` names the file here). The draft holds the packages installed on purpose, the services enabled in `rc.conf` and their knobs, what listens now (`sockstat`), the jail's volumes as `data`, the names of the files below `/usr/local/etc` and `/var/log` changed after the last package operation, and `setup` lines with the owners the app's directories have in the jail; the base system's services, ports and logs are left out. It never holds a secret: configuration files are listed by name only, a secret-looking knob is written as `TODO`, a knob with a shell expansion is left out. The comment at the top lists what was found and left out.
  - `jailops app validate` reports each line that still holds a `TODO` marker as `FILE: line N: replace TODO` (exit 2). The daemon does not look for them, so a draft installs while it is being written.
  - New route `GET /api/v1/jails/{name}/app-draft` (`AppDraft`: `jail`, `definition`, `todo`, `findings`; operator in the project, audited with counts only, `busy` for a stopped jail, `invalid` for a Linux jail; extension `app_draft`), `Jails().AppDraft` in the SDK and the fake (`SeedAppDraft`). The helper accepts exactly one more form, `pkg -r <jail root> query -e "%a = 0" "%n %v %R %w"` (a new `RestExact` list of a command rule), and refuses every other `pkg query -e`; the in-jail commands (`sockstat -4 -6 -l -q`, `find DIR -type f -newer /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite`, `stat -f "%Su:%Sg %N" PATH...`) go through the jail guard like every exec. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host: the output of these commands in a jail.
- **Local apps**: `apps.local_dir` in `jailopsd.yaml` (default `/usr/local/etc/jailops/apps`) is read with the packaged catalog on each request, so a `NAME.yaml` (and its icon) dropped there is listed and installable at once, without a package. `GET /api/v1/apps` and `GET /api/v1/apps/{name}` carry `source` (`catalog` or `local`; additive) and `overrides: catalog` for a local definition that hides a packaged one of the same name, which wins until it is removed; an invalid local definition is listed as invalid with the reason and its hint points at `apps.local_dir`. `jailops app list --source local|catalog`, a `SOURCE` column, `(local)` in the short table and a `Source:` line in `app info`; `SeedLocalApp` in the fake. `jailops doctor` reports `apps.local_dir` when the directory exists (definitions, invalid ones, or that the daemon cannot read it). The host console shows a small **local** chip on local apps (the Apps page, the app's page with "overrides the catalog's definition", the Installed tab), and the demo has a local memcached.


- **Appliance mode, designed** (`docs/appliance.md`): JailOps may manage the host itself, one module at a time and only where the administrator opts in; light CLI-only use stays the default and nothing changes for hosts that do not. The document covers the opt-in model, drift, dry runs with a diff, snapshots and restore, boot environments, "commit confirmed" for network and firewall changes (the revert timer lives in the privileged helper), six modules in build order, a first-boot wizard and an installer image, and the security model. Only module 1 is built. `docs/design.md` has a principle and status rows for it, `docs/security-model.md` a pointer.
- **Host identity (module 1)**: the host name, `/etc/resolv.conf` and NTP, off by default. Enabling it takes both `host.manage.modules: [identity]` in `jailopsd.yaml` and `host-manage = identity` in `priv.conf`; with either missing a change answers the new error code `not_managed` (HTTP 403) with the lines to add, and reading still works.
  - API (extension `host_identity`): `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/host/identity` (kind `HostIdentity`), `GET /api/v1/host/snapshots`, `POST /api/v1/host/snapshots/{name}/restore`. A change needs a global admin (operator is not enough), is audited and can be a dry run that returns a unified diff and the list of actions. SDK `c.HostSystem().Identity()` (`Get`, `Apply`) and `c.HostSystem()` (`Snapshots`, `Restore`); the fake serves the routes (`fake.WithHostManaged()`).
  - Helper: four new operations. `host.identity.read` is read-only; `host.identity.apply` and `host.snapshot.restore` need the admin assertion and `host-manage`; `host.snapshot.list` lists. The helper takes validated fields, never a file: it renders `/etc/resolv.conf` (first line `# managed by jailops`) and the block between `# jailops begin` and `# jailops end` of `/etc/ntp.conf` (other lines untouched), sets only `hostname`, `ntpd_enable` and `ntpd_sync_on_start` with `sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf`, runs `hostname` and `service ntpd restart|onestop`, writes atomically, keeps a copy of every file it changes first in `host-dir` (new `priv.conf` key, default `/var/db/jailops-priv/host`, root only, the last 20 snapshots) and puts it back when a step fails. A restore keeps a copy of what it replaces. Refusal tests cover every field.
  - CLI: `jailops host show` (without a name: this host), `jailops host identity set [--hostname] [--nameserver]... [--search]... [--ntp-server]... [--ntp enable|disable] [--dry-run]`, `jailops host snapshots`, `jailops host restore [SNAPSHOT]` (snapshot names complete).
  - Doctor: `host.identity` (not managed, or drift from what was applied) and `host.ntp` (ntpd enabled and synchronised).
  - Console: a Host page (`/host`, shown when the server has the extension): the identity form, the managed state with the exact lines to enable, Preview (the diff) before Apply, snapshots with Restore, a drift badge.
  - `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh`: with `JAILOPS_E2E_HOST=1` (off by default, CI does not set it) it enables the module, applies a host name and documentation-range resolvers, checks hostname(1), the files and `sysrc`, restores and checks the originals byte for byte. UNVERIFIED on FreeBSD until that block has run.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-10-30

- **The application catalog is released on its own.** The definitions and icons left this repository: they live in the packages repository (`main/jailops-apps/apps/` of `jailops/jailops-packages`), and the `jailops-apps` package has a version of its own, so a new or changed app is one pull request there and no JailOps release. The `jailops` package depends on `jailops-apps` by name, any version. `packaging/apps/` is gone; the tests, the console's demo notes and `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh` use a reference copy in `internal/apps/testdata/catalog/` (refreshed by hand when the format changes; `JAILOPS_E2E_CATALOG` names another directory for the end-to-end test). `docs/apps.md` describes the pull request flow.
- **`jailops app validate PATH...`** checks catalog definitions on the machine it runs on, without a server, a network or root: a catalog directory (every `*.yaml`, as the daemon lists them) or single files, parsed and validated with the daemon's own code, and the icon each one names must be next to it and readable. Every problem is printed as `FILE: reason`; the exit status is 2 when there is one, 0 with a one-line summary otherwise; `-o json` and `-o yaml` print the counts and the problems. The CI of the packages repository runs it before it builds `jailops-apps`. The client now links `internal/apps` for this; a test keeps that package and what it imports free of daemon code (the installer's rc.conf variables are its own type now, converted to the renderer's).
- A definition written for a newer daemon (an unknown key, format version or category) is listed as invalid with the reason, the others are unaffected: that was the behaviour, a test of the catalog listing now checks it and `docs/apps.md` states it, since a catalog update can reach a host before the JailOps update it needs.
- **Three new apps in the catalog** (now in the packages repository, each with an icon of its own; `docs/apps.md` has a table of the eight apps with their ports, health checks and where their facts come from). The three install and run on a FreeBSD host in the end-to-end test (`JAILOPS_E2E_APPS`); what is not yet checked is listed in `docs/apps.md`.
  - `isms` (category security): the information security management platform from the JailOps package repository (`pkg -r ROOT install -y -r jailops isms`; the host's pkg configuration must have the `jailops` repository). It is enabled but not started and nothing is generated: it needs a PostgreSQL database and a master secret first. The setup gives `/var/db/isms`, `/var/db/isms/private` and `server.env` back to `isms` with modes 0750, 0700 and 0600. The notes are the manual steps (role and database in a `postgresql` jail, `server.env`, the secret, the signing key, `isms server migrate`, `service isms start`) until `jailops app allow` connects apps. Port 8080 answers in the end-to-end test; what it answers is UNVERIFIED, so the definition has no health check, because nothing is started.
  - `nsd` (category network): the authoritative DNS server NSD on 53/udp and 53/tcp, with a starter configuration and one zone, `example.com`, on the volume `/var/db/nsd`, checked with `nsd-checkconf` and `nsd-checkzone` before the start; health tcp 53. The notes have the lines for a primary and for a secondary with zone transfers.
  - `mail` (category communication): a starting point for a single-domain mail server, Postfix (25, 587) and Dovecot 2.3 (143; 993 once TLS is set), system users with their homes on the volume `/home/mail`, the queue on `/var/spool/postfix`, `sendmail_enable="NONE"` and a `mailer.conf` that hands `/usr/sbin/sendmail` to Postfix, `postfix set-permissions` after `pkg -r`; health tcp 25. The notes cover users, the domain, TLS and the DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
- App categories `network` and `security` (the API's `AppCategory`, `jailops app list --category`, the console's category chips).
- `health` was always optional in a definition, and `docs/apps.md` now says so; the starter catalog leaves it out only for an app that starts none of its services. The catalog test (on the reference copy) checks that rule, the repositories, nsd's UDP and TCP ports, mail's services and `mailer.conf`, and the owners the setup lines give; a new daemon test dry-runs `isms`, `nsd` and `mail` and installs `isms` through the fakes (from the `jailops` repository, no service started).
- The fake server of `sdk/fake` starts with six definitions (with `isms`, `nsd` and `mail`), and its install steps, like the console's demo, name one `install-packages-<repo>` step per repository as the daemon does.
- `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh`: `JAILOPS_E2E_APPS` accepts `nsd` (`drill` for the SOA of `example.com` over UDP and TCP, `nsd-checkconf`), `mail` (the SMTP and IMAP greetings, `mailer.conf`) and `isms` (a `postgresql` jail `isms-db`, the steps of the notes, port 8080 answering); with `isms` and no `jailops` repository on the host the script stops at once with the reason.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-10-30

- The rollback command that the app install report, the console's install dialog and a failed package update show is now one the CLI accepts: `jailops jail rollback NAME --all --snapshot SNAPSHOT`. It used to say `--scope all`, which is not a flag. A test parses the printed command with the real command tree.
- The Valkey definition's summary is now "In-memory key-value store under the BSD license.", and its description no longer names another project.
- `jailops app install NAME` without `--image` uses the only FreeBSD image with the alias `stable`, as `NAME@stable`. It used to use `freebsd@stable`, which does not exist on a host that followed the quick start (`freebsd-15`). With no such image, or more than one, the request is refused before the operation, and the hint lists your images and says to name one with `--image`.
- **System V IPC for a jail**: the new jail key `sysvipc` (`spec.sysvipc`, `jailops config set NAME sysvipc=true`, allowed in a profile, applied at the next start) renders `sysvmsg = new; sysvsem = new; sysvshm = new;` into the jail's `jail.conf`: System V message queues, semaphores and shared memory of the jail's own, never the host's. An app definition asks for it with `sysvipc: true` (a strict boolean); the PostgreSQL definition does, because `initdb` failed with "Failed system call" on `shmget` in a jail without it. The helper accepts exactly `= new` for the three parameters. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.
- **A daemon started by a jail's rc no longer holds the caller's pipes**: every `jail.conf` sets `exec.consolelog = "/var/log/jail_${name}_console.log"`, so the output of `/etc/rc`, `/etc/rc.shutdown` and the hooks goes to that file on the host (FreeBSD and Linux jails). A forgejo jail did not start any more ("WaitDelay expired before I/O complete"): the daemon(8) supervisor of its rc script kept the pipes of `jail -c` open. A failing `jail -c` or `jail -r` names the file in its hint. The command runner also treats a command that exited 0 while a leftover process still held its output as a success. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host.
- `jailops app install` and the provisioning `services.start` step start a service with a fixed wrapper, `/bin/sh -c '<constant script>' jailops-start NAME`, which sends the rc script's output to a temporary file in the jail and prints it only when the start fails; the service name is an argument, never shell text, and is checked before the command is built. The install step's error names `/usr/sbin/service NAME start` with that output. Forgejo's `service forgejo start` used to wait for ever. `setup` and `health.exec` commands stay plain argv.
- The Valkey definition creates `/var/log/valkey` and `/var/run/valkey` if needed and gives them, with `/var/db/valkey`, to `valkey:valkey`: `pkg -r` installs from the host, where the package's user does not exist, so its directories came out root-owned and the server could not open its log file. `docs/apps.md` explains the limitation (pkg's database records no owners, so they cannot be restored generically) and what a definition must do; a test checks the owners the starter catalog sets.
- `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh`: `JAILOPS_E2E_APPS="postgresql valkey prometheus forgejo"` (any of them) installs those apps after nginx, each in its own block, with a check of its own (`select 1`, `PONG`, `/-/ready`, port 3000 answering 200 or a redirect), lists the jail's log files and stops it. CI does not set it.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-29

- **The logs of a jail are read through the API**: `jailops jail logs NAME` lists the files below `/var/log` of the jail's root (rotated copies included; compressed ones are listed but not readable) and `jailops jail logs NAME FILE` prints the last lines of one as plain text, with `--tail N`, `--since 15m` (lines whose timestamp is not older; a line without one belongs to the preceding line), `--grep TEXT` (a plain substring) and `-f` to follow, which continues at the server's `next_offset` and starts over when the file is rotated; `-o json` prints the reply. The top-level `jailops logs NAME [FILE]` is the same command. It works for a running jail and for a stopped one whose root is mounted; otherwise it answers `busy: jail "x" is not mounted` with the dataset to mount. New routes `GET /api/v1/jails/{name}/logs` and `GET .../logs/{file}` (extension `jail_logs`, `Jails().Logs` and `Jails().Log` in the SDK and the fake), operator role (logs hold secrets; the role that may exec), audited once per identity, jail and file every five minutes. The helper gained two read-only operations, `fs.list_logs` and `fs.tail_file`, that accept only the log directory of a jail root and plain names below it, follow no symlink below the jail root, read regular files only and at most 1 MiB per call.

- `jailops jail logs NAME` used to stream the log events the server publishes; that is now `jailops jail logs NAME --events` (with `--since-id` and `--count` as before).

- **The OS upgrade of a jail works through the privileged helper**: the `/etc` merge of `jail upgrade`, `update apply` and `image upgrade` makes two archives with `tar -cf`, which the helper refused (only listing and extracting were allowed), so the upgrade stopped at the merge step on a real host and rolled the jail back. The helper now accepts exactly `tar -C <root> -cf <.merge-*>/old-etc.tar|new-etc.tar ./etc`. The FreeBSD end-to-end test now upgrades a jail to a new generation, checks that its data survived and rolls the root back.

- `jailops doctor` checks `net.inet6.icmp6.nd6_onlink_ns_rfc4861` (`sysctl.net.inet6.icmp6.nd6_onlink_ns_rfc4861`) while a network in IPv6 proxy mode exists: the routers of a shared segment probe the host's address from their global addresses, FreeBSD's default drops those solicitations as off-link, and the router marks the host unreachable for minutes every few hours. The check warns that the setting is recommended, with the command and the `/etc/sysctl.conf` line; `sysctl.persistent` warns until the line is there. JailOps never sets it. The helper's read allow-list has the new name.

- `network.ndproxy` warns instead of failing while the capture of the uplink is being opened (`Starting`, the first minutes after `jailopsd` starts); a capture that cannot be opened, a failed sync or a stopped proxy still fail. The reconcile loop looks at a proxy it just started once more after the debounce instead of a whole interval later.

- `jailops network create --ipv6-mode proxy` (and from a file, and `apply`) warns, in the answer and on the client's standard error, when the sysctl above is 0 on the host. The warning is in `status.warnings` of the answer only; it is never stored.

- **The application catalog** (`docs/apps.md`): a definition of a jail that runs packages (packages, rc.d services and knobs, ports, data paths, configuration files, logs, setup commands, health check, resource hints, notes), one strict YAML file per app, installed on the host by the signed `jailops-apps` package under `/usr/local/share/jailops/apps` (`apps.catalog_dir` in `jailopsd.yaml`). The daemon reads these local files only and never fetches anything; a definition that does not validate is listed as invalid with the reason and can never be installed. New routes `GET /api/v1/apps` and `GET /api/v1/apps/{name}` (any authenticated identity, extension `apps`), `Apps().List/Get` in the SDK and the fake, `jailops app list` (patterns, `--category`, `-c`, `--sort`, every output format) and `jailops app info NAME`. The starter catalog in `packaging/apps/` has `postgresql`, `nginx`, `valkey`, `forgejo` and `prometheus`, written against the FreeBSD 15 quarterly packages.

- **Installing an app from the catalog** (`docs/apps.md`): `jailops app install NAME [--name JAIL] [--network N] [--storage S] [--image I] [--memory M] [--disk D] [--cpu N] [--dry-run] [--no-wait]` creates a jail that runs an app as one operation: a thin jail from `freebsd@stable` with the definition's data paths as volumes and the labels `jailops.app` and `jailops.app.hash`, started, the packages installed from the host with `pkg -r` through the privileged helper (the installed version becomes `jailops.app.version`), the services enabled in the jail's `rc.conf` (written through the helper's file operations, every value escaped, no shell), the setup commands and the services run in the jail through the in-jail exec, the health check (`tcp` and `http` from the host, `exec` in the jail, retried for `wait_seconds`), and a snapshot `app-installed` of the fresh installation. The report says how to reach it, where the data, configuration and logs are, and the notes. A failure before the jail's first start deletes the jail again; after it the jail is left stopped for inspection with its labels, the error says so, and a daemon restart in the middle does the same from the journal. `--dry-run` returns the steps. `jailops app installed` lists the jails that came from the catalog (jail, app, version, state, addresses, ports). New route `POST /api/v1/apps/{name}/install` (operator in the project, extension `app_install`), events `app.installed` and `app.install.failed`, `Apps().Install` and `Apps().Installed` in the SDK and the fake. Ports marked `expose` are recorded only; forwarding them is a later feature. The FreeBSD end-to-end test installs `nginx` from the starter catalog and fetches its default page from the host. UNVERIFIED on a FreeBSD host until that run.

- `jailops app install`: while an installation holds a jail, `exec`, `shell` and console sessions into it are refused (`busy`, "the app is being installed"): `pkg -r` works on the jail root from the host as root and nobody else may change that tree meanwhile. `docs/security-model.md` describes what remains (the packages' scripts run as root chrooted into the jail root).

- The app catalog refuses two services whose names are the same in rc.conf (`foo-bar` and `foo_bar`), an `rc` key that sets the `_enable` of any service, and a `data` or `config` path that is one of the persistent datasets of every jail (`/var/db`, `/var/log`, ...; the installer also checks the host's `lifecycle.persistent`). `GET /api/v1/apps` reads no icons and at most 512 definitions; the first one beyond is listed as invalid.

- `jailops app install`: a dry run creates nothing (it made the project's datasets); a failure of the create step after the jail was made deletes the jail; a daemon restart during the start of the jail deletes it, as the documentation said; the health check ends within `wait_seconds` (and one attempt of at most 5 seconds) instead of counting attempts.

- The listing of a jail's logs reads at most 4097 entries of a directory and 64 subdirectories in the helper; a listing that was cut carries the header `X-Jailops-Truncated: true`. `jailops jail logs NAME FILE` replaces escape sequences and other control characters of the lines with U+FFFD (`-o json` is unchanged).

- `jailops doctor` warns (`jail.volumes`) about volume datasets with `canmount=on`, made before volumes were created with `canmount=noauto`, and lists `zfs set canmount=noauto <dataset>` for each.

- **The host console has Apps pages and a log viewer**: `/apps` is the catalog (search, category filters with counts, cards with icon or monogram, version and ports; invalid definitions with their reason), `/apps/NAME` the definition (packages, services, ports, data paths and their volumes, configuration files, logs, health check, resource hints, notes, hash) and the install dialog: jail name, network and storage from the project's grants, optional limits, a dry-run preview of the steps, then the operation with its steps ticked off from the operation's progress and a report (jail, addresses, endpoints, paths, notes, the `app-installed` snapshot and the rollback command; on a failure the step, the hint and the kept jail). The Installed tab lists the project's jails with the label `jailops.app`, with links to exposed web ports. A jail's new Logs tab lists its files below `/var/log` and shows the tail with line count, since and text filters, follow (once a second from `next_offset`, across rotations, paused while the browser tab is hidden), wrap, copy and download; control characters are stripped and lines are only ever shown as text. Install is offered to operators of the project; the reason is shown otherwise. All of it works in the demo mode (`?demo`).

## 0.2.1 - 2026-10-29

- **Images are built from the packages of their own release**: the base repository of a RELEASE image was written as `base_release_${VERSION_MINOR}` and pkg expanded the minor from the ABI it was given, which has none, so every image came from `base_release_0`: a 15.1-RELEASE image had a 15.0 userland (`uname -U` 1500068 against 1501000 on the host), and `pkg` in its jails refused newer packages. The minor of the image's release is now written into the URL, and the end-to-end test checks that a jail's userland matches the host's. Images built before this keep their 15.0 userland until the next generation is built from them (`jailops image build NAME --from gN`), which now reads the right repository.

- **An image can be upgraded as a whole**: `jailops image upgrade IMAGE` builds the next generation from the newest one and
  then moves every thin jail that uses the image to it, one jail at a time, through the same steps as `jail upgrade`
  (snapshot, new root, `/etc` merge, swap, health check, automatic root rollback), writing the same update history and
  events as `update apply`. It stops at the first jail that fails or needs a human, so a bad generation is not rolled across
  the host; the jails after it are listed as not attempted. When the package set did not change, no generation is kept and
  no jail is touched. Thick jails, Linux jails, other update strategies and pinned jails are skipped and listed; a stopped jail
  is moved and left stopped. `--project P` narrows it to one project, `--no-jails` builds only, `--dry-run` plans and lists.
  New route `POST /api/v1/images/{name}/upgrade` (global admin, extension `image_upgrade`), `Images().Upgrade` in the SDK
  and the fake, and an "Upgrade" button in the web console.

- **The `jailops` client acts on several jails at once**: `start`, `stop`, `restart` and `delete` take `-l key=value` (the labels of `list -l`) or `--all` instead of names; a bulk delete asks for the project name to be typed (or `-y`). `create --start` starts the new jail at once, `delete --force` stops a running jail first, and `--grace` takes a duration (`30s`, `1m30s`) as well as seconds.

- `jailops list` takes name patterns (`list 'web*'`), `-c name,state` chooses the columns, `--sort COLUMN` orders the rows, `-o csv` prints the table as CSV and `-o compact` the plain borderless table on a terminal too. The output of a pipe is unchanged. `list --state` refuses a state that does not exist and completes the real ones.

- `jailops apply -f FILE` creates or updates every document of a YAML or JSON file (jails, images, networks, projects, storage, firewall policies, address sets, backup targets and policies, profiles, hosts), leaves unchanged objects alone and supports `--dry-run`.

- `-q/--quiet` leaves out confirmations such as `jail/web started`; errors and requested output still print.

- `jailops exec` allocates a pseudo-terminal on its own when stdin and stdout are terminals; `-T` runs without one (`-t` names the default).

- `jailops image create` takes the architecture from the server when `--arch` is not given (an arm64 host no longer gets amd64 images) and fails with a hint when the server cannot tell.

- One generation notation: `gN` wherever a command takes a generation (`image build --from`, `jail upgrade --generation`, `image alias set`, `image delete-generation`); a bare number and `IMAGE#gN` are accepted too.

- `jailops jail snapshot show JAIL SNAPSHOT`; `jailops image|network|project show` print a short human form (header, specification next to status) instead of raw YAML, as `jail show` does; `-o yaml` and `-o json` are unchanged.

- `jailops update check` with no names checks every jail of the project (`--all` says the same).

- Shell completion continues after the first name (`jailops stop web <TAB>`, `delete a b <TAB>`), completes snapshot names, image aliases and generations, and the values of `--state`, `--layout`, `--update-strategy`, `--os`, `--arch`, `--source-type`, `--ipv6-mode`, `--compression`, `--kind`, `--verify-mode`, `--type`, `--host`, `--remote`, `--profile`, `--firewall-policy`, `--depends`, `--target` and `--to-host`.

- Flag names line up: `jailops trust add --permission` (as `token create` and `user create`; `--role` still works, unlisted), `remote create` and `remote delete` next to `add` and `remove`, `backup restore --to-host` by host name or UUID, `jailops jail label` next to `jailops label`; `--project` is documented on `events` and `op list`, which it narrows.

- Generated help says "Create an image" and "an address set" instead of "a image"; the fake server answers `exec` and `shell` on a stopped jail with the hint of the real daemon ("start it first").

- **Lists read better on a terminal.** `jailops jail list` (and every other list) is a short boxed table when standard output is a terminal: for jails NAME, STATE, IPV4, IPV6, IMAGE (with the generation) and AGE, every address of a jail on its own line with its network, long IPv6 addresses never cut; a narrow terminal loses the least important columns first. `-o wide` shows every column as before; a pipe, a file, `--no-headers` and `-o json|yaml|name` print exactly what they did, so scripts are unaffected. `network list` on a terminal shows both address families.

- `jailops jail info NAME` (also `jailops info NAME`): a short report on one jail for a person: state and JID, type, image and generation, storage, dates, limits and usage, every interface with all its addresses (family and scope), snapshots, the update policy with the last update, labels and problems. `-o json|yaml` gives the same data structured. A part the server cannot give is said to be missing, never guessed. `show` is unchanged.

- **A jail's resource usage is measured on request**: `GET /api/v1/jails/{name}/usage` (readonly, extension `jail_usage`, `Jails().Usage` in the SDK and the fake) answers what the jail uses now: processes, CPU time and resident memory from the kernel's resource accounting (`rctl -u jail:<key>`, a new read-only form on the helper's command allow-list, accepted for managed jails only) while it runs, and the space of its datasets (`used` and `referenced` of the root, `used` of the persistent datasets and volumes) always. Nothing is stored and the jail list stays as cheap as before. When racct is off (`kern.racct.enable`), when `rctl` fails or when a dataset cannot be read, the reply carries the reason instead of zeros, and `jail info` prints it (`Usage: - (racct is off: ...)`); otherwise it prints `processes 23, cpu 2h13m, memory 388.2 MiB of 2G` and `Disk: root 256.0 MiB used (1.5 GiB referenced), data 70.0 MiB`. Interface counters are not part of it. UNVERIFIED on a host: the rctl output format is implemented from rctl(8).

- **Shell completion is installed by the packages**: the FreeBSD client package and the Linux packages carry the bash, zsh and fish scripts of `jailops` and `jailops-sync` under `share/` (`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/`, `.../zsh/site-functions/`, `.../fish/vendor_completions.d/`), generated from the built binaries at package build time (`scripts/gen-share.sh`); the release archives of the client carry them too. Completing names against a server that does not answer gives up after a moment and prints nothing.

- **Man pages**: the packages and release archives install them the usual FreeBSD way. `jailops` and `jailops-sync` have one mdoc page per command (`man jailops-jail-list`), generated from the command tree at package build time by the hidden `man DIR` command of each tool (deterministic, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` honoured); `jailopsd(8)`, `jailops-priv(8)` and `jailops-backupd(8)` are written by hand in `packaging/man/`. `scripts/gen-share.sh` replaces `gen-completions.sh` and produces completion scripts and man pages together into `bin/share`.

- `jailops-backupd`: `<command> --help` prints the synopsis, a description and the flags on standard output and exits 0 (it used to print `flag: help requested` and exit 1); `-c FILE`, `--config FILE` and `--json` are accepted after the command too (`status --json`); `--version` is an alias of `version` in every tool (`jailopsd`, `jailops-priv`, `jailops-backupd`, `jailops-sync`, `jailops`); `check-config` validates the configuration and the files it names without the network, and the rc.d script runs it (`service jailops_backupd checkconfig`) and refuses to start with a bad configuration; a second `init` reports the existing repository and its owner and exits 0; `init --admin NAME --password-prompt` (and `users add --password-prompt`) ask for the password on the terminal; `completion bash|zsh|fish` prints a completion script, which the backup node package installs.

- `jailops-priv`: `-h` prints a synopsis before the flags, `init --help` works and exits 0, and `init` checks its arguments (`-pool`) before it asks for root.

- `jailops-sync`: an unknown command or flag, or the wrong arguments, exits 2 like the other tools (it was 1) and points at `--help`; `sync`, `plan`, `drift`, `doctor`, `secrets set` and `remote bootstrap` have examples in their help.

- The rc.d header of `jailopsd` says there is no `reload` (SIGHUP is ignored by design; a renewed certificate is picked up on its own), and docs/troubleshooting.md tells where the backup node logs and how to read its status and jobs.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-27

- **Getting started turns the web console on**: `sysrc jailopsd_web=YES` (or `jailopsd -web`) now also opens the TLS listener on port 39110 when `listen.https.address` is empty, so one line puts the console in a browser; `web.enabled: true` in the file alone still opens no listener. `jailops-priv init -web` writes the same two settings into the `jailopsd.yaml` it creates. The guides use the rc.conf knob and the provisioning example turns it on (`JAILOPS_WEB=no` leaves it off); leave it out for a host you reach with the CLI only.

- **The API is under `/api/v1/` on every service** (it was `/1.0/`), and the web console is on `/`: the same layout for `jailopsd`, `jailops-backupd` and `pkgops serve` (which already used `/api/v1/`). The old paths are gone, not aliased. The CLI, the SDK, `jailops-sync`, the consoles, the hub, the docs and the tests use the new paths; the version number in the answer (`api_version: "1.0"`) is unchanged. Nothing under `/api/` is ever answered with the console. The backup node's unauthenticated `GET /api/v1` no longer tells the host name, host id or software version.

- `just build` and `just build-freebsd` always build the web consoles first, so the binaries always have everything embedded (before, you had to run `just web-all` yourself, or the daemon had no console).

- **The web consoles are in every binary and off until you turn them on.** `web.enabled` defaults to `false` in `jailopsd` (it was `true`) and in the shipped `backupd.yaml`. Turn the host console on with `web.enabled: true`, `sysrc jailopsd_web=YES` or `jailopsd -web`; `jailopsd_web=NO` and `-no-web` force it off. Hosts that used the console must set one of these.
- **Backup node, upgrading:** the node now has one TLS listener on `listen` (default `:39111`, every interface unless you bind an address). It serves the host API (mutual TLS), the management API (users, tokens, sessions; it used to be on a loopback listener of its own, `web.listen`, which is gone: delete it) and, with `web.enabled: true`, the console. `web.enabled` switches the console only. The two ways of proving who you are are independent: the host API needs a valid certificate of an enrolled, non-revoked host (401 otherwise), the management API takes no identity from a certificate (an administrator is not turned away by the certificate the browser offers, and a host certificate is never an administrator). The listener is TLS 1.3 only, password hashing is bounded to one hash per CPU at once (429 beyond that), and a management request has 15 seconds to arrive.
- **One port per service, in a range of our own: 39110 to 39112**, documented in docs/ports.md. `jailopsd` TLS API and console 39110 (was 8443; still off until you set `listen.https.address`), `jailops-backupd` 39111 (was 8444) for the hosts **and** for its management API and console, which now share that port (the second listener, `web.listen` on 8445, is gone: setting it is an error), `pkgops serve` 39112. `jailops remote add` without a port uses 39110.
- `jailops-backupd version`, its `/1.0` answer and its log now report the release version. The release stamp (`-X main.version`) never reached it, so the 0.1.0 binaries say `0.1.0-dev`. CI now checks that every command declares `var version`.
- README and docs/install.md say what is true today: the JailOps packages are in the repository, and the status block is replaced by a link to the roadmap.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-26

This is the first release, so the list below is ordered by area, not by date: what changes behaviour first, then
networking, security, fleets, packaging, and the groundwork.

### Advertised features that did not work
Everything below used to be reachable from the CLI, the SDK or the docs and answered `unsupported` at run time.
- `jailops jail console` and `Jails().Console()` are real: they use the console session protocol the web console uses
  (HTTP requests and server-sent events), with a raw local terminal and window resize forwarding. The fake server
  implements the same routes. Verified against the fake and the in-process daemon; UNVERIFIED on a real host.
- Removed: `jail create --package` and `jail create --encrypted`, `storage create --encrypted`, and
  `Jails().Freeze()` with the `freeze` action (FreeBSD has no jail freeze). A spec that still sets `packages` or
  `encrypted` is refused with `unsupported` and a hint (provisioning `packages` step; the manual ZFS encryption-root
  recipe in docs/storage.md). Native ZFS encryption and packages at creation remain unbuilt.
- Still `unsupported` (HTTP 501, listed in `sdk/PROTOCOL.md` and design section 16): `PUT /server`, cluster routes,
  listing console sessions, jail logs history, file access, cold moves, snapshot rename, volume management of an
  existing jail, bundle download, jail templates, groups, rollouts, and the backup transport routes.
- Documented as not enforced or not driven: the rate-limit shaper (stored, not enforced), `zfs_delegation` (accepted,
  never handed to the jail), replication between hosts (a library, no API or CLI), the `inplace` strategy for thin
  jails (refused). The "OpenAPI is planned" note now says there is no OpenAPI document today.
- Tests: the service layer is tested directly on the in-memory fakes (scope checks, error mapping, create rollback at
  every injected failure), `fleet/apply` and `fleet/rollout` have unit tests, and the helper session tests wait for
  observable output instead of sleeping.

### Image aliases and deletion
- Deleting an image removes it with all its generations and aliases; it is refused only while a jail references a generation, and the error names the jails.
- Deleting a generation that only aliases reference moves each alias to the newest remaining generation, or removes it when none remains (a generation a jail uses is still refused).
- Aliases are managed explicitly: `jailops image alias set IMAGE ALIAS [GENERATION]` and `jailops image alias delete IMAGE ALIAS` (replacing `image alias ... [--remove]`), `PUT|DELETE /1.0/images/{name}/aliases/{alias}` (admin, extension `image_aliases`), `Images().SetAlias/DeleteAlias` in the SDK and the fake, and buttons in the web console.

### One identity system, root as the break-glass
- The unix socket no longer maps Unix users or groups to roles. Peer uid 0 (root) is a global admin, the host's recovery access;
  every other local user is anonymous, exactly like an unauthenticated remote client (`GET /1.0`, `GET /healthz`, login, trust
  redemption, the static console) and authenticates with a token or a login over the socket. Removed: `listen.unix.admin_group`,
  `user_group`, `user_projects` (a configuration that sets one stops the daemon with a message), the `jailops-admin` group
  created by `jailops-priv init` (and its `-admin-group` option), and `JAILOPS_ADMINS` in `examples/provisioning`. The socket stays mode 0666: connecting confers nothing.
- Identities are managed from the host with `sudo jailops user ...`: `user create NAME --admin` (first administrator),
  `user set-password` (prompt, `--password-stdin` or `--generate`; no password ever on the command line), `user set-role`,
  `token revoke`. New API route `POST /1.0/users/{name}/password` (global admin), `Users().SetPassword` in the SDK and the fake, and user
  creation, role changes, password reset and deletion in the web console.
- Tests: root is a global admin; a non-root peer is anonymous on every route (the authorization matrix has an "anonymous
  local" column equal to "anonymous remote"); a token over the socket works for any uid. `temp/verify-identity.sh` is the check for a real FreeBSD host (not yet run).
- The backup node's admin socket follows the same rule: only root (uid 0) is an administrator there, the socket is mode 0600, and the `admin_group` key is removed (a configuration that sets it stops the node with a message). The management API/UI (127.0.0.1:8445) and the host listener are unchanged.

### Fleets, examples and exposure
- `jailops-sync`: `build: true` on an Image builds its first generation when the host has none, so a fresh host reaches a running jail
  with one `sync --apply`; `check` is an alias of `validate`; `validate` refuses what the daemon would refuse at apply time
  (name rules, overlapping subnets and datasets, IPv6 proxy and routed limits, reserved fields, `host_mounts` and
  `zfs_delegation` in a profile, `http://` to a non-loopback host); `adopt` notes host profiles the repository does not know.
- Examples (`examples/`), each with a README and an `EXPECTED-PLAN.md`, tested against in-memory hosts and the daemon's validators:
  `ipv6-switched-cloud`, `ipv6-routed-hetzner`, `web-stack`, `big-pool-tank`, `multi-host-fleet`, `provisioning`,
  `pkgops-packaged-service`. New pages: `docs/exposure.md`, `docs/provisioning.md`, `docs/api.md`.
- `jailopsd`: `web.enabled: false` switches the embedded console off and `-tags noweb` builds without it; the TLS listener serves a
  reloaded certificate (a renewed `listen.https.cert`/`key` needs no restart); a configured certificate is never generated or
  overwritten (a missing file or half a pair stops the start); `listen.https.address`, and `cert` without `key`, are validated at load.

### No default project, everything explicit
- A fresh host has no project. Every request about something a project owns names the project (`?project=`, or the
  current project set with `jailops project switch`); without one the server answers `400 a project is required`.
- A jail is created with a network and a storage named explicitly, in the jail or in a profile; nothing is filled in
  from the project. The project fields `default` on network and storage grants and `--default-network`/`--default-storage`
  are gone.
- A network belongs to one project: granting a network another project holds is refused, and grants are whole networks
  (no shared bridges, no per-project sub-ranges). Storage can still be shared; each project gets its own dataset tree
  and quota.
- Only `<mount>/projects/<project>/jails/<name>` exists on disk; the legacy layout of the default project is removed.
- `jailops-sync`: jails and project-level objects live under `projects/<project>/` only, rollouts name their project,
  two projects naming one network is a validation error, and `adopt` writes by project.

### Supported FreeBSD releases
- JailOps targets FreeBSD 15.1 and later; CI, the release workflow and the package build use 15.1 and the 15 ABI only. `jailops doctor` fails (`host.release`) on an older host. Examples and help
  texts use 15.1.

### Configuration
- `state_dir` defaults to `<data_dir>/state` (`/var/db/jailops/state`, where `jailops-priv init` mounts the state
  dataset) instead of a directory inside the root-owned storage mount, which the daemon cannot write. A test keeps
  `packaging/jailopsd.yaml` listing every key the daemon accepts.

### Audit fixes (proxy, host mounts, PF)
- The helper rechecks a jail's fstab when the jail starts and refuses a mount point or source that passes through a
  symbolic link; an unchanged host mount survives an operator's start or restart, and setting `host_mounts` or
  `zfs_delegation` needs a global admin, not a global operator.
- The NDP proxy announces new addresses only (own budget, up to three times), answers a repeated solicitation once,
  bounds answers per target, reports a closed capture in the network condition and the doctor, and backs off failed
  opens. The helper only speaks for addresses that have a `/128` host route through one of its interfaces, and the
  multicast sockets of the proxy stay on loopback and are closed with the proxy.
- A pass rule's label includes everything above it in the anchor, so a deny inserted above an unchanged rule ends the
  flows that rule admitted; an anchor whose loaded rules cannot be read is not replaced.

### Existing data in a jail
- A jail can mount existing host directories, for example datasets of a large pool JailOps does not manage:
  `host_mounts` in the spec, `--host-mount SOURCE:TARGET[:ro]` on create. Only a global administrator may set them, the
  source must lie below an `admin-host-mount` directory in the helper's `priv.conf`, profiles cannot carry them, and the
  mount point is created in the jail's root on every render. Everything else (jails on a big pool as storage, volumes
  with quotas) already worked and is explained on the website.

### Networking and IPv6
- IPv6 proxy mode has no Experimental switch any more (`experimental.ndproxy` is gone): a network in proxy mode always
  has its proxy, which answers for every address of a running jail (any prefix length inside the uplink's /64, for
  example a /80) and announces each address when it appears and whenever the capture is reopened. The operator's
  `ndp-proxy` line in `priv.conf` stays the authority; `jailops doctor` fails (`network.ndproxy`) with that line when a
  proxy network is not answering.
- A jail address on a switched IPv6 /64 can be given to a new jail with another hardware address; the kernel's cached
  neighbor entry of the old one no longer lingers (it is dropped when the host route is removed and before the next is
  made), so the host reaches the new jail at once.
- Deleting a network flushes its anchor whether or not it had NAT (the anchor also holds the pass of the gateway port).
- The helper offers `ndp.open` (a read-only, locked, filtered capture of an approved uplink) and `ndp.answer`
  (one advertisement, built by the helper) instead of the unconfigured `sys.open_bpf`. What may be answered is set by
  the operator in `priv.conf` with `ndp-proxy = <uplink>=<prefix>,...`; nothing works without it.
- The helper's audit lines now reach syslog under rc (`-log syslog`).
- Doctor accepts `gateway_enable` and `ipv6_gateway_enable` in rc.conf as persistent forwarding.
- A jail attached to a network without naming addresses gets one of every family the network has (dual-stack networks
  work with plain `--network NAME`); verified on a managed bridge with a /24 and a /80 of the host's routed /64.
- Debian images (`--source-type debootstrap`, glibc) build and run; the release signature is always checked.
- Copying an image into a jail happens inside the helper (`zfs.replicate`): 140 MB in 2 s instead of minutes.

### Packet filter
- The first Linux image build works from a clean host: the Linux modules and the fallback brand are asserted (through the
  reconciler's host pass, so with the helper's existing `kldload` and `sysctl` rules) before the build, and the host pass
  keeps them while a Linux image is defined. `doctor` warns (`network.dns`) about a network that jails use and that has
  no nameserver.
- The helper accepts `jexec <build jail> /sbin/apk` again: the image build jail (`jobuild-<image>-g<N>`) was refused by
  the jail-key check of the `jexec` rule (Alpine and Debian images could not be built). Linux jails (Alpine, Debian) were
  run with the new addressing on FreeBSD arm64 and amd64 (docs/linux-jails.md).
- **A jail has exactly the addresses JailOps gave it.** A jail holds its IPv4 address as `/32` and its IPv6 address as
  `/128` (also in routed mode), with default routes through the host (an on-link host route to the IPv4 gateway,
  `fe80::1` for IPv6), so jails reach each other only through the host and its PF; every jail port is a private bridge
  member (the `private` network option no longer has an effect). At attach the host installs permanent ARP and neighbor
  entries for the jail (removed at detach and by the stale-entry collection), sets `staticarp` on the gateway interface
  and pins the jail's MAC address to its port with a static forwarding entry; no jail may send a neighbour
  advertisement, and router advertisements and redirects are dropped (also from the host towards a jail). Verified with
  forged ARP, neighbour advertisements and router advertisements sent from inside the jails, an extra IPv4 or IPv6
  address, another jail's MAC address and a DHCP discover (the amd64 host, proxy mode; the arm64 host, routed mode). The anti-spoofing
  table holds the jail's own link-local address instead of `fe80::/10`, `::` passes only as DAD, and ICMPv6 errors
  (packet too big and the rest) always pass. Existing jails get the new addressing when they are restarted.
  `doctor` checks the proxy uplink (`network.uplink`), warns about a gateway interface that is not `staticarp` yet (`network.staticarp`) and warns without a `scrub` rule.
- Stale `/128` host routes of proxy networks are removed by the reconcile loop; a refused announcement is retried;
  other hosts' DAD for a proxied address is answered; proxy subnets are /48 to /126, overlapping network subnets are
  refused, and the reserved IPv6 addresses are never allocated.
- The gateway addresses of a network moved from the bridge to a gateway epair (the bridge is layer 2 only), so that a
  jail's traffic to the host and to routed networks meets the jail's own rules: `default_out: deny`, egress rules
  and anti-spoofing now work towards the host and the internet (they did not; see design 18.9).
- Projects are isolated from each other by default (every jail has an anchor); a project policy's defaults are a floor.
- Fixed pf grammar errors in the generated rules (`icmp6-type`, `tagged`), and the `::` source address (DAD) that pf
  silently dropped from the antispoof table. The unverified `network.pf_placement: bridge` option is gone.
- `scripts/ci-freebsd-pf.sh`: the packet filter tested with real traffic, run by the e2e script; with `FORGE_BIN` set it also sends forged ARP, ICMPv6 and router-advertisement frames from inside a jail (`scripts/forge`) and checks real effects, not rule text (phase 0e).
- Stopping a jail retries a busy unmount for a few seconds; the daemon waits for the helper's socket at start.

### Security
- The reconciler's host pass can be asserted on demand (`Reconciler.AssertHost`), so building a Linux image loads the
  Linux kernel modules and sets the fallback brand before it runs, instead of needing a Linux jail to already exist;
  the host pass also keeps them loaded while a Linux image is defined. `doctor` warns (`network.dns`) about a network
  in use with no nameserver, and (`network.staticarp`) about a gateway interface a jail started before this version
  left resolving addresses with ARP.
- `jailopsd`'s `REQUIRE` line now names `pf` (`packaging/rc.d/jailopsd`): without it rcorder had no reason to start pf
  before jailopsd, and a host where it lost that race would have no filtering at all, not even the administrator's
  default-deny, while jailopsd created bridges and started jails (design 18.14). The helper's `fs.read_file` can now
  read `/etc/rc.conf` (read-only, like `/etc/sysctl.conf` and `/etc/resolv.conf` already were): `doctor`'s persistent-
  forwarding check reads it for `gateway_enable`/`ipv6_gateway_enable` and, without this, always warned even when
  they were set (found live on the amd64 host).
- Boot-order audit (design 18.14): a jail's own PF anchor loads only after its `exec.start` (the guest's whole boot)
  finishes, which an anchor call that resolves to nothing falls through safely on a default-deny host with the anchor
  line placed correctly (both checked by `doctor`), but depends on pf actually being up, which the `REQUIRE: pf` fix
  above now guarantees. Measured at the daemon level with a jail whose `exec.start` sent spoofed-source pings (refused
  by the kernel before leaving it: a jail cannot bind a raw socket to an address it does not own) and forged ARP from
  the first instant it ran: zero packets reached either an external observer or a local capture, and a production
  jail's reachability had no downtime. A literal power-cycle reboot could not be measured on the test host: its
  disposable, loopback-file ZFS pool does not survive a reboot (`/tmp` is cleared at boot, and `zpool import -a` does
  not scan arbitrary file paths even from a location that is cleared) — a property of the test harness, not of
  JailOps or of this fix.
- The NDP proxy's per-target answer budget is now keyed by `(target, requester MAC)`, not by target alone: a flood of
  solicitations for one address that only forges its claimed source IP (free, no state) can no longer drain what a
  different requester's own address — notably the real router's — needs for the very same target (design 18.10).
- `scripts/forge` (built by `just build-forge`) sends forged ARP, ICMPv6 and router-advertisement frames from inside a
  jail for the PF test matrix's forgery phase (0e, `FORGE_BIN`): real effects are asserted (host ARP/ND caches
  unchanged, the victim's traffic keeps flowing, the attacker gains no address, nothing reaches the uplink), not rule
  presence.
- TOTP codes are single-use under concurrency; password and TOTP-confirmation checks are rate-limited; hubs refuse
  authentication endpoints and unaddressed claims; client certificate dates and key usage are enforced; JSON bodies
  need `application/json`; session cookies are tied to the transport; stricter CSP, HSTS; backup-node login limits,
  login Origin check, bad-token limit and session invalidation on password change.
- The helper's authority over file agents comes from records it holds itself (datasets it created incomplete, snapshots
  it made for a backup), never from ZFS user properties, which the daemon can set.
- The daemon's state directory is its own (a separate dataset outside the storage root); the helper no longer reads or
  writes there. The storage root and the scratch directory belong to root and are checked before every use.
- The helper validates the pkg repository configuration it is pointed at (signed, http(s) URL), accepts `devfs unhide`
  only for known device paths, restricts `mount.fstab` to its own directory, leaves existing directories alone in
  `MkdirAll`, and bounds the life of a file agent.
- A hub cannot reach the login, credential or session endpoints of a host; a requestor claim must name its audience;
  client certificates are checked for validity period and key usage.
- Browser consoles reach jail terminals through a session over POST and server-sent events (`jail_console`).

### Fleet sync and secrets
- Fleet repositories can hold SOPS-encrypted files: `shared/secrets.sops.yaml` (jail environment values
  `secret:<dotted.path>`, sealed to the hosts when applied, hashed from the stored ciphertext so plans need no key)
  and `hosts/<host>/remote.sops.yaml` (url, pinned server fingerprint and an encrypted client certificate for
  pinned mTLS), governed by a `.sops.yaml` policy. The existing `secrets/<name>.age` mechanism is unchanged.
- The key comes from `SOPS_AGE_KEY`, `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` (age plugin identities work) or `SOPS_AGE_KEY_CMD`.
- New commands: `vault status|list-recipients|add-recipient|remove-recipient` and
  `remote list|bootstrap`; `validate` and `doctor` check the SOPS files; `render` never decrypts.
- `jailops-sync` has the SOPS/age workflow: `shared/secrets.sops.yaml`, per-host `remote.sops.yaml` (pinned mTLS with a
  generated client certificate), `vault` commands for recipients, `remote bootstrap`, `secrets add-hosts`.
- Jail `env` is now used (every process started in the jail), and a host opens `sealed:age:` values with its own age
  key (`sealed_secrets`, `secrets_recipient`).
- Run against a real FreeBSD host: adopt with claim, plan, apply (a dual-stack network, a project grant, a jail), drift
  on a declared key, revert on apply.

### Packaging and installation
- FreeBSD packages (`jailops-client`, `jailops`, `jailops-backupd`) and a signed pkg repository (`scripts/pkg-build.sh`,
  `scripts/pkg-repo.sh`), GoReleaser archives and Linux packages (`.goreleaser.yaml`), a release workflow and CI
  (`.github/workflows`), including a FreeBSD VM job that runs `scripts/ci-freebsd-e2e.sh`.
- `jailops-priv init -pool POOL` sets a host up (user, datasets, directories, configuration); rc.d scripts for
  `jailopsd`, `jailops_priv` and `jailops_backupd`; a sample `backupd.yaml` and a systemd unit for Linux backup nodes.
- Backups work with the unprivileged daemon: file agents (`internal/fsagent`) read snapshots and write restored jails
  for it; `jailops label` sets the labels policies select by; a policy is looked up by project and name.

- Full restore tests boot the restored backup as a hidden jail without a network and check it from the inside.

### Fixes found by running on FreeBSD
- Pseudo-terminals use `posix_openpt` and `FIODGNAME` (FreeBSD has no `/dev/ptmx`); `exec -t` and `shell` work.
- Fleet reconcile passes are serialised (the timer and a manual pass could conflict on a project generation).
- Doctor works through the unprivileged daemon and the helper: `kldstat -q -n`, `pfctl -s rules|nat`, `kern.racct.enable`.

### Foundations, module path and rename
- Repository, design document, Justfile, API types (`sdk/api`).
- The Go module path is `jailops.net/jailops` (SDK: `jailops.net/jailops/sdk`), served by a `go-import` page on jailops.net.
- New logo: an isometric cube with bars and a prompt, as SVG (`docs/brand/`), used by the website, the favicons and
  the web consoles. The files are generated by `scripts/make_logo.py` in the website repository.
- The project is now JailOps (`jailops`, `jailopsd`, `jailops-priv`, `jailops-sync`, `jailops-backupd`).
- Repository on-disk format v1 identifiers (magic bytes `JOCH`/`JOIX`/`JOMF`/`JOCT`, recovery key prefix `JOR1`,
  key-derivation namespaces, gear-table seed) were renamed before the format was ever released, and the golden
  vectors were regenerated once; they are pinned again from here on.
